With Him “is no variableness,\n\nneither shadow of turning.” Isaiah 57:15; Habakkuk 3:6; James 1:17.\n\nEvery manifestation of creative power is an expression of infinite\n\nlove. The sovereignty of God involves fullness of blessing to all\n\ncreated beings.... The history of the great conflict between good and\n\nevil, from the time it first began in heaven to the final overthrow of\n\nrebellion and the total eradication of sin, is also a demonstration of\n\nGod’s unchanging love.\n\nThe Sovereign of the universe was not alone in His work of\n\nbeneficence. He had an associate—a coworker who could appreciate\n\nHis purposes, and could share His joy in giving happiness to created\n\nbeings. “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with\n\nGod, and the Word was God.” ... Christ, the Word, the only begotten\n\nof God, was one with the eternal Father—one in nature, in character,\n\nin purpose—the only being that could enter into all the counsels and\n\npurposes of God....\n\nThe Father wrought by His Son in the creation of all heavenly\n\nbeings. “By him were all things created ... whether they be thrones,\n\nor dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created\n\nby him, and for him.” ... The Son, the anointed of God, the “express\n\nimage of his person,” “the brightness of his glory,” “upholding all\n\nthings by the word of his power,” holds supremacy over them all....\n\nThe law of love being the foundation of the government of God,\n\nthe happiness of all intelligent beings depends upon their perfect\n\naccord with its great principles of righteousness.

Ezekiel 28:15.\n\nSo long as all created beings acknowledged the allegiance of\n\nlove, there was perfect harmony throughout the universe of God.\n\nIt was the joy of the heavenly host to fulfill the purpose of their\n\nCreator. They delighted in reflecting His glory and showing forth\n\nHis praise. Andwhile love to Godwas supreme, love forone another\n\nwas confiding and unselfish. There was no note of discord to mar\n\nthe celestial harmonies. But a change came over this happy state.\n\nThere was one who perverted the freedom that God had granted to\n\nHis creatures. Sin originated with him who, next to Christ, had been\n\nmost honored of God and was highest in power and glory among the\n\ninhabitants of heaven. Lucifer, “son of the morning,” was first of the\n\ncovering cherubs, holy and undefiled. He stood in the presence of\n\nthe great Creator, and the ceaseless beams of glory enshrouding the\n\neternal God rested upon him....\n\nLittle by little Lucifer came to indulge the desire for self-ex-\n\naltation.... Though all his glory was from God, this mighty angel\n\ncame to regard it as pertaining to himself. Not content with his\n\nposition, though honored above the heavenly host, he ventured to\n\ncovet homage due alone to the Creator. Instead of seeking to make\n\nGod supreme in the affections and allegiance of all created beings, it\n\nwas his endeavor to secure their service and loyalty to himself. And\n\ncoveting the glory with which the infinite Father had invested His\n\nSon, this prince of angels aspired to power that was the prerogative\n\nof Christ alone...\n\nTo dispute the supremacy of the Son of God, thus impeaching\n\nthe wisdom and love of the Creator, had become the purpose of this\n\nprince of angels.

He was disloyal to God. His\n\nmourning and complaining aroused sympathy among the angelic\n\nhosts, and many took the same position as did Satan [Lucifer]. How\n\ndid the Lord break the force of these accusations?\n\nBecause of Satan’s accusing power, it was not the plan of God to\n\ndealwithhim as he deserved.

He would make it\n\nappear that if he could have moved according to his own judgment\n\nall this demonstration of rebellion would have been avoided.\n\nThe condemning power of Satan would lead him to institute a\n\ntheory of justice inconsistent with mercy. He claims to be offici-\n\nating as the voice and power of God, claims that his decisions are\n\njustice, are pure and without fault. Thus he takes his position on\n\nthe judgment seat and declares that his counsels are infallible. Here\n\nhis merciless justice comes in, a counterfeit of justice, abhorrent to\n\nGod.\n\nBut how shall the universe know that Lucifer is not a safe and\n\njust leader? To their eyes he appears right. They cannot see, as\n\nGod sees, beneath the outward covering. They cannot know as God\n\nknows. To work to unmask him and make plain to the angelic host\n\nthat his judgment is not God’s judgment, that he has made a standard\n\nof his own and exposed himself to the righteous indignation of God,\n\nwould create a state of things that must be avoided.\n\nIt was on account of Satan’s deceiving power that many angels\n\nbecame disloyal to God. God was true and right. Satan was wrong\n\nand he was convinced that he was wrong. He must now choose,\n\neither by submission to place himself on the Lord’s side, or by lying\n\nto sustain himself. By sophistry and fraud he appeared to gain an\n\n28\n\nNoExcuseForSin,January 5 29\n\nadvantage, but it was only for a short time. God cannot lie; He\n\nmoves in a direct line.

And on the seventh day God ended his work which he\n\nhad made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work\n\nwhich he had made. Genesis 2:1, 2.\n\nHuman philosophy declares that an indefinite period of time was\n\ntaken in the creation of the world. Does God state the matter thus?\n\nNo; He says, “It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for\n\never; for in six days [not six indefinite periods of time, for then there\n\nwould be no possible way for us to observe the day specified in the\n\nfourth commandment] the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the\n\nseventh day he rested, and was refreshed.” Please read carefully the\n\nfifth chapter of Deuteronomy. God says again, “Remember [do not\n\nforget] the sabbath day, to keep it holy.... For in six days the Lord\n\nmade heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested\n\nthe seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and\n\nhallowed it.”\n\nYet with the living oracles before them, those who claim to\n\npreach the Word present the suppositions of human minds, the max-\n\nims and commandments of humans. They make void the law of\n\nGod by their traditions. The sophistry in regard to the world’s being\n\ncreated in an indefinite period of time is one of Satan’s falsehoods.\n\nGod speaks to the human family in language they can comprehend.\n\nHe does not leave the matter so indefinite that human beings can\n\nhandle it according to their theories. When the Lord declares that\n\nHe made the world in six days and rested on the seventh day, He\n\nmeans the day of twenty-four hours, which He has marked off by\n\nthe rising and setting of the sun.\n\nGod would not pronounce the death sentence for a disregard\n\nof the Sabbath unless He had presented before His people a clear\n\nunderstanding of the Sabbath.... When the foundation of the earth\n\nwas laid, the foundation of the Sabbath was laid also. When the\n\n42\n\nSignificanceOfTheSabbath,January 12 43\n\nmorning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy,\n\nGod saw that a Sabbath was essential for Adam and Eve, even in\n\nParadise. In giving them the Sabbath, God considered their spiritual\n\nand physical health.\n\nGod made the world in six literal days, and on the seventh literal\n\nday He rested from all His work which He had done, and was re-\n\nfreshed. So He has given human beings six days in which to labor....\n\nBy thus setting apart the Sabbath, God gave the world a memorial.\n\nHe did not set apart one day and any day in seven, but one particular\n\nday, the seventh day. And by observing the Sabbath, we show that\n\nwe recognize God as the living God, the Creator of heaven and\n\nearth.—Letter 31, 1898."

Isaiah 45:12, NRSV.\n\nAdam and Eve received knowledge through direct communion\n\nwith God, and they learned of Him through His works. All created\n\nthings, in their original perfection, were an expression of the thought\n\nof God. To Adam and Eve nature was teeming with divine wisdom.\n\nBut by transgression the human family was cut off from learning\n\nof God through direct communion and, to a great degree, through\n\nHis works.... Upon every page of the great volume of His created\n\nworks may still be traced His handwriting. Nature still speaks of\n\nher Creator. Yet these revelations are partial and imperfect. And\n\nin our fallen state, with weakened powers and restricted vision, we\n\nare incapable of interpreting aright. We need the fuller revelation of\n\nHimself that God has given in His written word.—Education, 16,\n\n17.\n\nAll heaven took a deep and joyful interest in the creation of the\n\nworld and of Adam and Eve. Human beings were a distinct order.\n\nThey were made “in the image of God,” and it was the Creator’s\n\ndesign that they should populate the earth. They were to live in close\n\ncommunion with heaven, receiving and assimilating power from the\n\ngreat Source of power. Upheld by God, they were to live sinless\n\nlives.\n\nSatan determined to defeat God’s plan. We need not try to\n\nunderstand the motives that prompted the being next to Christ in\n\nthe heavenly courts to bring envy and jealousy into the ranks of\n\nthe angels. To many he communicated his disaffection, and there\n\nwas war in heaven, which ended in the expulsion of Satan and his\n\nsympathizers. We need not puzzle our minds for a reason that Satan\n\nacted as he did. Could a reason be found, there would be excuse for\n\n44\n\nFirstTransgressionInexcusable,January 13 45\n\nsin. But there is no excuse. There is no reason human beings should\n\ntravel over the same ground that Satan traveled....\n\nAfter Satan was thrust from heaven, he determined to set up his\n\nkingdom on this earth. Through him sin entered the world, and death\n\nby sin. By listening to his misrepresentation of God, Adam fell from\n\nhis high estate, and the floodgates of woe were opened upon our\n\nworld.\n\nThere is no excuse for Adam’s transgression. All his wants\n\nwere generously supplied. He had need of nothing more. Only one\n\nprohibition was laid upon him.... This prohibition Satan used as a\n\nmeans of insinuating suggestions of evil.—Manuscript 97, 1901."

The holy pair was placed in Paradise and surrounded\n\nwith everything that was pleasant to the eye or good for food. A\n\nbeautiful garden was planted for them in Eden. In it were stately\n\ntrees of every description, all that could serve for use or ornament.\n\nFlowers of rare loveliness, and of every tint and hue, perfumed the\n\nair. Merry songsters of varied plumage caroled joyous songs of\n\npraise of the Creator.\n\nParadise delighted the senses of the holy pair, but this was not\n\nenough; they must have something to call into play the wonderful\n\nhuman organism. He who formed them knew what would be for\n\ntheir good; and had happiness consisted in doing nothing, they, in\n\ntheir state of holy innocence, would have been left unemployed.\n\nBut no sooner were our first parents created than God appointed\n\nthem their work.

Genesis 3:1.\n\nIn order to accomplish his work unperceived, Satan chose to\n\nemploy as his medium the serpent—a disguise well adapted for\n\nhis purpose of deception. The serpent was then one of the wisest\n\nand most beautiful creatures on the earth. It had wings, and while\n\nflyingthroughtheairpresentedanappearanceofdazzlingbrightness,\n\nhaving the color and brilliancy of burnished gold. Resting in the\n\nrich-laden branches of the forbidden tree and regaling itself with the\n\ndelicious fruit, it was an object to arrest the attention and delight the\n\neye of the beholder. Thus in the garden of peace lurked the destroyer,\n\nwatching for his prey.\n\nThe angels had cautioned Eve to beware of separating herself\n\nfrom her husband while occupied in their daily labor in the garden;\n\nwith him she would be in less danger from temptation than if she\n\nwere alone. But absorbed in her pleasing task, she unconsciously\n\nwandered from his side. On perceiving that she was alone, she felt\n\nan apprehension of danger, but dismissed her fears, deciding that she\n\nhad sufficient wisdom and strength to discern evil and to withstand\n\nit. Unmindful of the angels’ caution, she soon found herself gazing\n\nwith mingled curiosity and admiration upon the forbidden tree. The\n\nfruit was very beautiful, and she questioned with herself why God\n\nhad withheld it from them.\n\nNow was the tempter’s opportunity. As if he were able to discern\n\nthe workings of her mind, he addressed her: “Yea, hath God said,\n\nYe shall not eat of every tree of the garden?” Eve was surprised and\n\nstartled as she thus seemed to hear the echo of her thoughts.... To\n\nthe tempter’s ensnaring question she replied: “We may eat of the\n\nfruit of the trees of the garden: but of the fruit of the tree which is in\n\nthe midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither\n\n48\n\nTemptationSometimesDisguisedAsPleasure,January 15 49\n\nshall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman,\n\nYe shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat\n\nthereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods,\n\nknowing good and evil.”...\n\nSuch has been Satan’s work from the days of Adam to the\n\npresent, and he has pursued it with great success. He tempts people\n\nto distrust God’s love and to doubt His wisdom. He is constantly\n\nseeking to excite a spirit of irreverent curiosity, a restless, inquisitive\n\ndesire to penetrate the secrets of divine wisdom and power. In their\n\nefforts to search out what God has been pleased to withhold, multi-\n\ntudes overlook the truths that He has revealed, and that are essential\n\nto salvation.—Patriarchs and Prophets, 53-55."

The curse of sin was the knowledge they gained. Eve coveted\n\nthe thing God had forbidden. She revealed a distrust of God and His\n\ngoodness, and a desire to be independent and do as she thought best.\n\nEve offered the fruit to Adam and became his tempter. She would\n\nbe a god.

But that apparently smallest of sins constituted her a\n\ntransgressor of the law of God....\n\nThe Lord Jesus came into our world and was tempted by the\n\nsame enemy. He passed over the ground where Adam fell, but He\n\nwas steadfast. He resisted the devil, and in behalf of the human race\n\nwas Conqueror. The universe of heaven triumphed. Satan came\n\nto Christ with his specious temptations to induce Him to question\n\nthe plans and law of God, and to make Him occupy an independent\n\nposition; but the tempter was foiled.

Cursed is the ground for thy sake;\n\nin sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. Genesis\n\n3:16, 17.\n\nEve was told of the sorrow and pain that must henceforth be her\n\nportion. And the Lord said, “Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and\n\nhe shall rule over thee.” In the creation God had made her the equal\n\nof Adam. Had they remained obedient to God—in harmony with\n\nHis great law of love—they would ever have been in harmony with\n\neach other; but sin had brought discord, and now their union could\n\nbe maintained and harmony preserved only by submission on the\n\npart of the one or the other.\n\nEve had been the first in transgression; she had fallen into temp-\n\ntation by separating from her companion, contrary to the divine\n\ndirection. It was by her solicitation that Adam sinned, and she was\n\nnowplacedinsubjection toherhusband. Hadtheprinciplesenjoined\n\nin the law of God been cherished by the fallen race, this sentence,\n\nthough growing out of the results of sin, would have proved a bless-\n\ning to them. But man’s abuse of the supremacy thus given him has\n\ntoo often rendered the lot of woman very bitter and made her life a\n\nburden.\n\nEve had been perfectly happy by her husband’s side in her Eden\n\nhome. But, like restless modern Eves, she was flattered with the\n\nhope of entering a higher sphere than that which God had assigned\n\nher. In attempting to rise above her original position, she fell far\n\nbelow it....\n\nTo Adam the Lord declared: “Because thou hast hearkened\n\nunto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I\n\ncommanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: . . In the sweat\n\nof thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for\n\n60\n\nSinForcedChangeInGod’sPlans,January 21 61\n\nout of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou\n\nreturn.”\n\nIt was not the will of God that the sinless pair should know aught\n\nof evil. He had freely given them the good, and had withheld the\n\nevil. But, contrary to His command, they had eaten of the forbidden\n\ntree, and now they would continue to eat of it—they would have\n\nthe knowledge of evil—all the days of their life. From that time the\n\nrace would be afflicted by Satan’s temptations. Instead of the happy\n\nlabor heretofore appointed them, anxiety and toil were to be their\n\nlot. They would be subject to disappointment, grief, and pain, and\n\nfinally to death.—Patriarchs and Prophets, 58, 59."

Christ and Satan are not at an\n\nagreement, and they never will be. In every age the true church of\n\nGod has engaged in decided warfare against satanic agencies. Until\n\nthe controversy is ended, the struggle will go on between wicked\n\nangels and wicked people on the one side, and holy angels and true\n\nbelievers on the other.\n\nThe battle that is raging will grow more fierce as the end ap-\n\nproaches. Those who are in unity with satanic agencies are desig-\n\nnated by the Lord as the children of darkness. There is not, and\n\ncannot be, a natural enmity between fallen angels and fallen hu-\n\nmans. Both are evil. Through apostasy both cherish evil sentiments.\n\nWicked angels and wicked people are leagued in a desperate confed-\n\neracyagainstthegood. Satanknewthatifhecouldinducethehuman\n\nrace, as he had induced angels, to unite with him in his rebellion, he\n\nwould have a strong force with which to carry on his rebellion.\n\nIn the hosts of evil there is jarring and discord, but they are all\n\nfirm allies in fighting against heaven. Their one aim is to disparage\n\nGod, and their great numbers lead them to entertain the hope that\n\nthey will be able to dethrone Omnipotence.\n\nWhen Adam and Eve were placed in the Garden of Eden, they\n\nwere innocent and sinless, in perfect harmony with God. Enmity had\n\nno naturalexistence in theirhearts. Butwhen theytransgressed, their\n\nnature was no longer sinless. They became evil, for they had placed\n\nthemselves on the side of the fallen foe, doing the very things that\n\nGod specified they should not do. Had there been no interference on\n\nthe part of God, fallen humans would have formed a firm alliance\n\nwith Satan against heaven.

Genesis 3:15.\n\nThe Lord said concerning Satan, that old serpent, that he should\n\nbruise the heel of Christ, but Christ would bruise his head. Thank\n\nGod, he cannot touch the head. “With the mind I myself serve the\n\nlaw of God,” said the apostle. The mind and heart are enlisted in\n\nthe service of Christ, while Satan has enlisted humans and fallen\n\nangels to join in his company to league against good. They can\n\nbruise only the heel, while in the very act, when Satan seems to\n\nhave triumphed in putting them to torture and death, the faithful who\n\nstand in defense of the law of Jehovah are wounding the head of the\n\ngreat rebel.\n\nThis prophecy of enmity between Satan and Christ is far-reach-\n\ning. It is a delineation of an unwearied conflict between Christ and\n\nHis followers, Satan and his angels, and fallen humans united in a\n\ndesperate companionship to reproach, bruise, wound, and extermi-\n\nnate the followers of Christ to the close of time. This controversy\n\nbetween Satan and Christ was carried on here in this world. Satan\n\nwas constantly afflicting the Son of God and creating prejudice in\n\nthe minds of people. Not only were Christ’s doctrines and teachings\n\nperverted, misinterpreted, and wrested from their true meaning, but\n\nfalsehoods followed Him everywhere. The misrepresentations that\n\nthe chief priests, Pharisees, and Sadducees poured into the ears of\n\nthe people appealed to the worst passions of adulterers, fornicators,\n\nand the dishonest, exciting a burning prejudice that made it almost\n\nimpossible for Him to live upon the earth for even three and a half\n\nyears after His public ministry began.\n\nWhy, then, Christ has said, should those who bear the truth of\n\nGod to the world be discouraged and fainthearted? “If the world\n\nhate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.” Ye “are not\n\nof the world, even as I am not of the world.” They will “revile you,\n\n64\n\nEnmityBetweenChristAndSatan,January 23 65\n\nand persecute you, and ... say all manner of evil against you falsely,\n\nfor my sake.”“Yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will\n\nthink that he doeth God service. And these things will they do unto\n\nyou, because they have not known the Father, nor me.”\n\nSatan’s malignity reached its height when the Lord of Glory was\n\ncrucified, and we may expect in our day that human hearts will be\n\nopen to prejudice and to the falsehoods, wicked misrepresentations,\n\nand slander of those who love this kind of satanic work. It is a\n\nwisdom from beneath. It is hell-born, and its results will be as in\n\nChrist’s day.—Manuscript 55, 1886."

The world\n\nthat God had made was blighted with the curse of sin and inhabited\n\nby beings doomed to misery and death. There appeared no escape\n\nfor those who had transgressed the law. Angels ceased their songs\n\nof praise. Throughout the heavenly courts there was mourning for\n\nthe ruin that sin had wrought.\n\nThe Son of God, heaven’s glorious Commander, was touched\n\nwith pity for the fallen race. His heart was moved with infinite com-\n\npassion as the woes of the lost world rose up before Him. But divine\n\nlove had conceived a plan whereby the lost might be redeemed. The\n\nbroken law of God demanded the life of sinners. In all the universe\n\nthere was but One who could, in behalf of humanity, satisfy its\n\nclaims. Since the divine law is as sacred as God Himself, only one\n\nequal with God could make atonement for its transgression. None\n\nbut Christ could redeem fallen humans from the curse of the law\n\nand bring them again into harmony with Heaven. Christ would take\n\nupon Himself the guilt and shame of sin—sin so offensive to a holy\n\nGod that it must separate the Father and His Son....\n\nBefore the Father [Christ] pleaded in the sinner’s behalf, while\n\nthe host of heaven awaited the result with an intensity of interest\n\nthat words cannot express. Long continued was that mysterious\n\ncommuning—“the counsel of peace” for the fallen human race. The\n\nplan of salvation had been laid before the creation of the earth, for\n\nChrist is “the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” Yet it\n\nwas a struggle, even with the King of the universe, to yield up His\n\nSon to die for the guilty race....

Who can know the\n\ndepths of that love that “passeth knowledge”? ...\n\nGod was to be manifest in Christ, “reconciling the world unto\n\nhimself.” Human beings had become so degraded by sin that it was\n\nimpossible for them, in themselves, to come into harmony with\n\nHim whose nature is purity and goodness. But Christ, after having\n\nredeemed them from the condemnation of the law, could impart\n\ndivine power to unite with human effort. Thus by repentance toward\n\nGod and faith in Christ the fallen children of Adam might once more\n\nbecome “sons of God.”—Patriarchs and Prophets, 63, 64."

Genesis 4:25-5:3.\n\nTo Adam was given another son, to be the inheritor of the divine\n\npromise, the heir of the spiritual birthright. The name Seth, given\n\nto this son, signified “appointed,” or “compensation,” “for,” said the\n\nmother, “God ... hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel,\n\nwhom Cain slew.” Seth was of more noble stature than Cain or Abel,\n\nand resembled Adam more closely than did his other sons. He was\n\na worthy character, following in the steps of Abel. Yet he inherited\n\nno more natural goodness than did Cain. Concerning the creation of\n\nAdam it is said, “In the likeness of God made he him”; but Adam,\n\nafter the Fall, “begat a son in his own likeness, after his image.” ...\n\nThe Sabbath was honored by all the children of Adam that re-\n\nmained loyal to God. But Cain and his descendants did not respect\n\nthe day upon which God had rested. They chose their own time for\n\nlabor and for rest, regardless of Jehovah’s express command....\n\nFor some time the two classes remained separate. The race of\n\nCain, spreading from the place of their first settlement, dispersed\n\nover the plains and valleys where the children of Seth had dwelt;\n\nand the latter, in order to escape from their contaminating influence,\n\nwithdrew to the mountains, and there made their home.... But in the\n\nlapse of time they ventured, little by little, to mingle with the inhab-\n\nitants of the valleys. This association was productive of the worst\n\nresults. “The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were\n\nfair.” The children of Seth, attracted by the beauty of the daughters\n\nof Cain’s descendants, displeased the Lord by intermarrying with\n\nthem.

There must be a quickening of the sensibilities, that the\n\nmind may be fully awake to the work to be done for all classes, high\n\nand low, rich and poor, learned and ignorant. We are to reveal the\n\ntenderness shown by the great Shepherd as He gathers the lambs in\n\nHis arms and carefully guards His flock from harm, leading it in safe\n\npaths. Christ’s followers are to show His tenderness and sympathy,\n\nand they must also show His intensity of desire to impart the truths\n\nthat mean eternal life to the receiver.—Letter 97, 1902 (Manuscript\n\nReleases 12:213, 214)."

Jude 14.\n\nEnoch was an active worker for God. He did not seek ease and\n\ncomfort. Nor did he spend his time in idle meditation or in striving\n\nto gain happiness for himself. He did not participate in the festivities\n\nand amusements constantly engaging the attention of the pleasure\n\nlovers of the antediluvian world. In his day the minds of many were\n\nabsorbed in worldly pleasures—pleasures that tempted them to go\n\nastray. But Enoch was terribly in earnest. He did not idly saunter\n\nalong the streets or linger near places of amusement as if he were an\n\nindifferent worldling. He never engaged in common conversation\n\nwith those who were corrupt, as if he were one of them. With the\n\nsinful and with the workers of iniquity he mingled only as God’s\n\nmessenger, to warn them to turn with abhorrence from their evil\n\nways and to repent and seek God.\n\nEnoch lived an active, zealous life of self-denial. He walked\n\nwith God in a world so corrupt that the Lord afterward destroyed it\n\nby the Flood. And he walked with the ungodly as one among them,\n\nnot as one of them, but as one whose purposes and works and hopes\n\nwere based not only on time, but on eternity. He did not give the\n\nworldly-wise any reason to question his profession and his faith. By\n\nearnest words and decided actions he showed that he was separate\n\nfrom the world. After periods of retirement he would mingle with\n\nthe ungodly to exhort them to abhor the evil and to choose the good.\n\nAs a faithful worker for God he sought to save them. He warned\n\nthe world. He preached faith in Christ, the Saviour of sinners, the\n\nsinner’s only hope.\n\nEnoch was an Adventist. He carried the minds of people forward\n\nto the great day of God, when Christ will come the second time, to\n\njudge everyone’s work....\n\n104\n\nEnoch’sFaithWasAlwaysEvident,February 11 105\n\nLike Enoch, we must walk with God, bringing the will into\n\nsubmission to His will. We must be willing to go where Jesus leads,\n\nwilling to suffer for His dear sake. In seeking to save the souls for\n\nwhom Christ has died, in conquering difficulties, and in keeping\n\nourselves unspotted from the world, we reveal the genuineness of\n\nour religion. Faithful Christians do not seek the easiest place, the\n\nlightest burdens. They are found where the work is hardest, where\n\ntheir help is most needed.—Manuscript 36, 1902."

John 17:23.\n\nEnoch not only meditated and prayed, and put on the armor of\n\nwatchfulness, but he came forth from his pleadings with God to\n\nplead with unbelievers. He did not mask the truth to find favor with\n\nunbelievers, thus neglecting their souls. This close connection with\n\nGod gave him courage to work the works of God. Enoch walked\n\nwith God and had the testimony that his ways “pleased God.” This is\n\nthe privilege of every believer today. It is the believer dwelling with\n\nGod, and God taking up His abode with the believer. “I in them, and\n\nthou in me,” says Jesus. To walk with God and have the witness that\n\ntheir ways please Him is an experience not to be confined to Enoch,\n\nto Elijah, to patriarchs, to prophets, to apostles, and to martyrs.

Thus they are made useless for this life, and\n\nunfit for the future, immortal life. Christ in His life gave people\n\nan altogether different example. In His youth He worked with His\n\nfather at the carpenter’s trade; but the youth of today are educated to\n\nbelieve that it is the money that makes the person. The sure result of\n\nsuch education is seen in the pride, the vanity, the love of pleasure,\n\nthe sinful practices that are so prevalent in this degenerate age.\n\nWhere there is an abundance of idleness, Satan works with his\n\ntemptations to spoil life and character. If youth are not trained to\n\n108\n\nJesusInTheHeart,February 13 109\n\nuseful labor, whether they be rich or poor, they are in peril, for Satan\n\nwill find employment for them after his own order. The youth who\n\nare not barricaded with principle do not regard time as a precious\n\ntreasure, a trust from God for which every human being must give an\n\naccount. Money is also a trust from God. It is given to parents, not to\n\nuse in an extravagant way to gratify pride to the ruin of themselves\n\nand their children, but that they may be the means of doing good to\n\npersons in need.—Manuscript 43, 1900."

They\n\nrealized as fully then as we realize now the promise and the presence\n\nof God in their midst. Wherever Enoch found one or two who were\n\nwilling to hear the message he had for them, Jesus joined with them\n\nin their worship of God. In Enoch’s day there were some among the\n\nwicked inhabitants of earth who believed. The Lord never yet has\n\nleft His faithful few without His presence, nor the world without a\n\nwitness.\n\nEnoch was a public teacher of the truth in the age in which he\n\nlived. He taught the truth; he lived the truth; and the character of\n\nthe teacher who walked with God was in every way harmonious\n\nwith the greatness and sacredness of his mission. Enoch was a\n\nprophet who spake as he was moved by the Holy Ghost. He was\n\na light amid the moral darkness, ... a man who walked with God,\n\nbeing obedient to God’s law—that law that Satan had refused to\n\nobey, that Adam had transgressed, and that Abel had obeyed and,\n\nbecause of his obedience, been murdered over. And now God would\n\ndemonstrate to the universe the falsity of Satan’s charge that human\n\nbeings cannot keep God’s law. He would demonstrate that though\n\nhumans had sinned, they could so relate themselves to God that they\n\nwould have the mind and spirit of God and would be representative\n\nsymbols of Christ. This holy man was selected of God to denounce\n\nthe wickedness of the world, and to evidence to the world that it is\n\npossible for a person to keep all the law of God....\n\nEnoch walked with God, while of the world around him sacred\n\nhistory records: “And God saw that the wickedness of man was great\n\nin the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart\n\n110\n\nEnochKeptGod’sLaw,February 14 111\n\nwas only evil continually.” Enoch’s righteous life was in marked\n\ncontrast to the wicked people around him. His piety, his purity, his\n\nunswerving integrity, was the result of his walking with God, while\n\nthe wickedness of the world was the result of their walking with the\n\n[great] deceiver....\n\nEnoch was a representative man, but he is not praised, he is not\n\nexalted; he simply did that which every son and daughter of Adam\n\nmay do.—Manuscript 43, 1900."

It is stated, “Noah ... have I found righteous before\n\nme in this generation.” And it is also stated that “Noah walked with\n\nGod.” Noah did not stop to question, “What will the inhabitants of\n\nthe old world think of me if I begin to build this boat upon dry land?”\n\nHe believed just what God had told him, and he commenced to work\n\nupon the light and plan that God had given him.

The\n\nearth will be filled with the shrieks of suffering, expiring nations.\n\nThere will be war. The places of the earth will be in confusion,\n\nas from its bowels pour forth its burning contents to destroy the\n\ninhabitants of the world who, in their wickedness, resemble the\n\ninhabitants of the antediluvian world.\n\nIn that time [before the Flood], as in this, there were two classes,\n\nthe righteous and the wicked. Enoch and others walked with God\n\nin uprightness. But the great majority of the inhabitants of the earth\n\nwere given over to iniquity, and their wickedness rose before God....\n\nGod gave direction that an ark was to be built for those who\n\ndesired to be saved from the coming destruction. He was about\n\nto speak in determined language against the wickedness that had\n\ngrown to fearful proportions.

Those\n\nwho today hear the message of truth, but do not believe, will fall\n\namid the moral infidelity, even as in Noah’s day those who were not\n\nfirmly grounded failed to stand till the end of their probation.

Those who believe the truth and obey\n\nthe commandments will find refuge in Christ. They will have the\n\neffectual protection of His ever-loving care as long as they take their\n\nposition on the side of God and His law, which ever has governed,\n\nand ever will govern, His kingdom.—Manuscript 42, 1900."

    "content": "And Noah did according unto all that the Lord commanded\n\nhim. Genesis 7:5.\n\nAnd God said to Noah that he and his wife, and his sons and\n\ntheir wives, should come into the ark. You see how few there were\n\nwho would believe the message of Heaven, the Word of God, and\n\nthus be saved from the waters of the Flood. The consequences of the\n\ntransgression of God’s law were evidenced upon the population and\n\nupon the earth. Violence and corruption were prevailing everywhere.\n\nBut the time came when there was a singular sight witnessed\n\nby the inhabitants of the Noachic world. Those who had laughed\n\nand scoffed and derided Noah now could see that something was\n\ntaking place that was wonderful. There were seen coming, through\n\nthe forest and from every quarter, animals, two by two, making their\n\nway to the ark. These animals were obedient to the commandments\n\nof God, but humans were disobedient. Then there was seen, like a\n\ndark cloud in the heavens, the fowls of the air flocking to that ark.\n\nAt that moment this made an impression upon their minds. But as\n\nthey spent time with one another, in their unbelief and corruption\n\nthey put it away from their minds.\n\nThen the commandment was given for Noah and his family to\n\nenter the ark. The probation for the inhabitants of the Noachic world\n\nwas ended. Noah went into the ark and there was seen a bright\n\nlight—an angel of heaven came and shut the massive door.... Noah\n\nand his family were shut into the ark and the unrighteous were shut\n\nout. ThemercyofGodwaswithdrawnfromthatpollutedandcorrupt\n\ngeneration....\n\nIt was a tremendous test brought to bear upon Noah and his\n\nfamily; [they were] shut in that ark for seven days, and yet no rain\n\ncame. The jeers and scoffs and triumphs of their enemies seemed\n\ncomplete. But as soon as the seven days were ended, there began\n\n122\n\nWhenWeAreTested,WillOurFaithEndure,February 20 123\n\nto come in the dark and heavy clouds such as they had never seen\n\nbefore. The clouds increased in blackness, and the rain began to fall\n\nfrom them.\n\nUp to this time there had never been any rain, but a mist had\n\narisen and watered the earth. For this very reason the people had\n\ntaken occasion to triumph. But the rain continued to fall, and then\n\nthere were some serious thoughts. But in order to put these reflec-\n\ntions away from them, they went still deeper into their iniquity, and\n\nthey earnestly looked to see if there was not some evidence that the\n\nclouds were rolling back, but there was none. The rain increased\n\nuntil it came in torrents.—Manuscript 86, 1886."

Isaiah 51:4.\n\nGod had concealed in the earth His weapons whereby He would\n\npurify the earth at that time. The jets of water began to come up\n\nfrom the depths of the earth, and as this water increased in force, it\n\nwould throw up stones and uproot trees. Do you not think that there\n\nwere some who would have been glad at that time to find refuge\n\nin the ark? There were some reaching toward the ark, and some\n\nentreaties, but it was too late. They began to move their families,\n\nand they climbed up to the highest points of land ... and struggled\n\nfor refuge there. They would climb into the highest trees, thinking to\n\nfind refuge there, but these trees would be uprooted and they would\n\nbe buried in the waters of the earth.\n\nThus the inhabitants of that long-lived race perished in the Flood,\n\nandeventhebeastsperished, exceptthosethatwereintheark. Christ\n\nsaid, “As it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of\n\nthe Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they\n\nwere given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,\n\nand the flood came, and destroyed them all.” Thus shall it be when\n\nChrist shall be revealed at His second coming.\n\nThe law of God was first transgressed by Satan in heaven. He\n\nhas kept up his controversy upon that point till the present time,\n\nand will until the close of time. The test that was brought to bear\n\nupon the representative people in past ages will be brought to bear\n\nupon people in this age. Will men and women acknowledge the\n\ngovernment of the God of the universe and honor that government?\n\nDid it make the inhabitants of the old world any better by trampling\n\nupon the law of Jehovah? Did it improve their condition to separate\n\nthemselves from the law of their Creator? Will it make men and\n\n124\n\nResultsOfTransgressingGod’sLaw,February 21 125\n\nwomen any better in this age to put their feet upon God’s holy law\n\nand transgress it?\n\nThe very same results that were seen in the transgression of\n\nGod’s law by the inhabitants of the Noachic world will be seen in\n\nthe inhabitants of this generation. The rights and property, and even\n\nhuman life, were not respected then, but violated. The thoughts and\n\nimaginations of the heart were evil continually. They worshiped\n\nanything and everything but God. So it is in this age of the world—\n\ndeception, infidelity, and idolatry prevail to an alarming extent.—\n\nManuscript 86, 1886."

Genesis 9:25.\n\nTo repeople the desolate earth, which the Flood had so lately\n\nswept from its moral corruption, God had preserved but one family,\n\nthe household of Noah, to whom He had declared, “Thee have I\n\nseen righteous before me in this generation.” Yet in the three sons of\n\nNoah was speedily developed the same great distinction seen in the\n\nworld before the Flood. In Shem, Ham, and Japheth, who were to\n\nbe the founders of the human race, was foreshadowed the character\n\nof their posterity.\n\nNoah, speaking by divine inspiration, foretold the history of the\n\nthree great races to spring from these fathers of the human race.\n\nTracing the descendants of Ham, through the son rather than the\n\nfather, he declared, “Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall\n\nhe be unto his brethren.”... Evil characteristics were perpetuated in\n\nCanaan and his posterity, whose continued guilt called upon them\n\nthe judgments of God....\n\nThough the prophetic curse had doomed them to slavery, the\n\ndoom was withheld for centuries. God bore with their impiety and\n\ncorruption until they passed the limits of divine forbearance. Then\n\nthey were dispossessed, and became bondmen to the descendants of\n\nShem and Japheth....\n\nFor a time the descendants of Noah continued to dwell among\n\nthe mountains where the ark had rested. As their numbers increased,\n\napostasy soon led to division. Those who desired to forget their Cre-\n\nator and to cast off the restraint of His law felt a constant annoyance\n\nfrom the teaching and example of their God-fearing associates, and\n\nafter a time they decided to separate from the worshipers of God.\n\nAccordingly they journeyed to the plain of Shinar, on the banks of\n\nthe river Euphrates. They were attracted by the beauty of the situa-\n\n146\n\nEvilCharacterLeadsToApostasy,March 2 147\n\ntion and the fertility of the soil, and upon this plain they determined\n\nto make their home.\n\nHere they decided to build a city, and in it a tower of such stupen-\n\ndous height as should render it the wonder of the world. These enter-\n\nprises were designed to prevent the people from scattering abroad in\n\ncolonies. God had directed men and women to disperse throughout\n\nthe earth, to replenish and subdue it; but these Babel builders deter-\n\nmined to keep their community united in one body, and to found a\n\nmonarchy that should eventually embrace the whole earth....

Genesis\n\n12:2.\n\nIt was not a small trial to Abraham to be called to leave his home\n\nand acquaintances and go into a land that he knew not. When he\n\ncame into that land, he found that the Canaanites were there, and he\n\nwould have all their idolatry to meet.\n\nThis was a severe trial to Abraham’s faith. He could not see any\n\npossession that he could claim as his own. But in his perplexity the\n\nGod of heaven condescended to preach the gospel to him and show\n\nhim the possession that he should have for an eternal inheritance.\n\nAbraham moved from place to place, as it seemed advisable for\n\nhim, in order to obtain a support for his family, and his family was\n\nnot small. His trained servants numbered more than four hundred.\n\nAt every place where he pitched his tent, close beside it he erected\n\nan altar; so he worshiped God in every place where he was called to\n\nbe. In thus doing he was training his family to love and fear God....\n\nAll God’s followers, wherever they shall go, should carry the\n\ntrue principles of their religion with them. If sin, forgetfulness of\n\nGod, and idolatry exist in the places where they shall go, then is the\n\ntime for them to show their true principles.\n\nWhen we set ourselves where all is convenience and ease, we\n\ndo not feel so much the necessity of depending moment by moment\n\nupon God. God in His providence brings us into positions where we\n\nshall feel our necessity of His help and strength....\n\nNow, the Lord has a controversy with His people, and He wants\n\nevery one of us to come into obedience to His requirements. We\n\nare none of us, when duty is laid out before us, to question, “Is\n\nit convenient or will it please me to do this?” If God says it, it is\n\nenough.

Genesis\n\n13:9.\n\nAbraham was tested to see whether he would hear the voice of\n\nGod and obey. The Lord saw that it was not for his best spiritual\n\ninterest to remain in his country and among his relatives, where he\n\ncould not exert that influence over them that would be a blessing.\n\nHe told him to leave them. Abraham was a rich man, but in the\n\ngreatest simplicity he obeyed God and went out, a sojourner into a\n\nstrange country. As he left his home and his kindred, God assured\n\nhim that he would have earthly greatness and prosperity in the land\n\nof Canaan.\n\nWhy did not Abraham make use of all his means to bring about\n\nthis prosperity? Why did he not invest his means to enrich himself\n\nwith wealth and influence above anyone with whom he was brought\n\nin contact? Abraham did not do anything to glorify himself. He did\n\nnot aim at power. He did not aspire to greatness by building up cities\n\nand calling them by his name. He was content.\n\nThe record tells us that Abraham took Lot, his nephew, with him,\n\nand for a time they lived together. But their families were large,\n\nand there was a quarrel between the herdsmen of Abraham and the\n\nherdsmen of Lot over their cattle. “And Abraham said unto Lot, Let\n\nthere be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between\n\nmy herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren. Is not the whole\n\nland before thee?”...\n\nLot’s choice was the land of Sodom. Abraham dwelt in the\n\nland of Canaan and Lot in the cities of the plain, and he pitched his\n\ntent toward Sodom. But the men of Sodom sinned before the Lord\n\nexceedingly.\n\nHere is brought to view another separation. It makes a great\n\ndifference when and how a separation takes place. It was Lot’s\n\n154\n\nEffectOfChoices,March 6 155\n\nprivilege to inquire, to be very careful where he should go, very\n\ncareful in regard to the society he chose for his family. But without\n\nreference to the inhabitants, he chose a land that was beautiful\n\nin situation, that promised great returns. Lot went in rich, and\n\ncame forth with nothing as the result of his choice. It makes every\n\ndifference whether people place themselves in positions where they\n\nwill have the very best help of correct influences or whether they\n\nchoose temporal advantages. There are many ways that lead to\n\nSodom. We all need anointed eyesight, that we may discern the way\n\nthat leads to God.—Letter 109, 1899."

Separate thyself,\n\nI pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go\n\nto the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the\n\nleft.”\n\nLot saw that the country near Sodom was most favorable for his\n\nworldly and temporal prosperity, and he chose that location. If Lot\n\nhad manifested the same courtesy that Abraham had, he would have\n\ngiven him the choice. But Abraham did not take the position that he\n\nwas superior to everyone around him; he took a humble position. It\n\nwas the right of Abraham to make his choice, and to be first, but he\n\nchose to be courteous in this matter.\n\nLot, instead of inquiring whether this would be the most favor-\n\nable for his morality and godliness, thought only of his worldly\n\nprosperity.

    "content": "And there came two angels to Sodom at even: and Lot sat in\n\nthe gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them;\n\nand he bowed himself with his face toward the ground. Genesis\n\n19:1.\n\nLot had been kept with Abraham’s household, and he had be-\n\ncome so molded that he had the same courteous spirit that Abraham\n\nmanifested. These men [the angels] appeared just like other men\n\nwhen they came to Lot, and if a spirit of courtesy had not been\n\ncultivated by Lot, he might have perished with the rest of Sodom.\n\nThe wickedness of the inhabitants of Sodom was so great that they\n\nwould have abused the men who brought this message and were\n\nentertained by Lot. But angels of God protected Lot from being torn\n\nin pieces by the rabble that were outside his door. They smote them\n\nwith blindness so that they could not find the door.\n\nAfter this exhibition of wickedness the angels opened to Lot the\n\nobjectoftheirvisit. TheytoldLotthatifhehadanysonsordaughters\n\nin that place to bring them out of the city. Lot was permitted to go\n\nto his relatives and tell them that the city was to be destroyed and\n\nthat they must flee from it. But all his entreaties and all his warnings\n\nwere of no avail with them. They mocked at what they called his\n\nsuperstitious fears. Why, here was Sodom just as it had been, and\n\nthere was no evidence in anything their eyes beheld that led them to\n\nthink there was a destruction before them.\n\nBut the angel, as Lot returned, was in haste, and bade them flee\n\nout of Sodom. Lot was, as it were, stupefied at the thought that\n\nhe must go without his property, and with only his wife and two\n\nchildren with him. The angels laid hold upon them and led them out\n\nof the city.... As soon as they were out of the city and on their way\n\ntoward the mountain, the angel said to them, “Flee for your life, and\n\n162\n\nAngelsAreLimitedInWhatTheyCanDoForUs,March 10 163\n\ntarry not in all the plain.” The command was “Look not behind you.”\n\n...\n\nThe wife of Lot turned her eyes toward the city, [looking] for\n\nwhat she had left there; the curse of God came upon her, and she\n\nwas turned into a pillar of salt.... We can see that Lot made a mistake\n\nwhen he made his home in Sodom. Here he lost not only all his\n\npossessions; he lost all but two of his children. This is a lesson that\n\nwe should take to heart. There may be very flattering openings for\n\nthe children of God, but they must look on every side of the question\n\nbefore deciding. The very first question with every one of us should\n\nbe “How will it be with my soul?”—Manuscript 19 a, 1886."

Does it indeed seem meaningless, the requirement\n\nof the fourth commandment? Does not the habitual subjection to\n\nour heavenly Master’s will lead the obedient to ask constantly and\n\nearnestly, not “What is pleasing?” not “What is the most convenient\n\nor agreeable to self or those around us?” but “What does my Lord\n\nrequire?

Is this a\n\nmatter hard to comprehend, that obedience on our part to all God’s\n\nlaw is absolutely essential to eternal life? Is this an unfathomable\n\nmystery to the Christian—to secure the soul’s salvation at any cost\n\nto self or selfish interest? Does the Word of God give us any assur-\n\nance that we can get to heaven just as well transgressing the law as\n\nobeying it?

Then we must obey—without hesitating\n\nand seeking to find some way to be saved without obedience; this\n\nwould be climbing up some other way. “I am the way, the truth,\n\n164\n\nGiveNothingLessThanLovingObedienceToGod,March 11 165\n\nand the life.” “I have kept my Father’s commandments,” says the\n\nMajesty of heaven....\n\nWe shouldnotobey the commandments merely to secure heaven,\n\nbut to please Him who died to save sinners from the penalty of the\n\ntransgression of the Father’s law.

What are we willing to sacrifice for His love? Jesus\n\nsays, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” not to select out\n\none or two or nine, but the whole ten. All His commandments\n\nmust be kept. John tells us of those who pretend to love but do not\n\nobey God’s requirements. “He that saith, I know him, and keepeth\n\nnot his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.” “For\n\nthis is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his\n\ncommandments are not grievous.”\n\nYou may say, So you believe that all the learned world is wrong\n\nand that a poor company, greatly in the minority, looked upon as\n\nignorant, common people, are all that will be saved? I answer, Jesus\n\nwas among the lowly of the earth. He did not take His position\n\nby the side of the learned rabbis or the rulers. He was not found\n\namong the potentates of earth, but among the lowly ones. The truth\n\nwas never found among the majority.

They sang the glad tidings of a Saviour over Bethlehem’s\n\nplains while the great, the rulers, and the honorable were left in\n\ndarkness because they were perfectly satisfied with their position\n\nand felt no need of a piety greater than that which they possessed.\n\nTeachers in the schools of the prophets, the scribes and priests and\n\nrulers, were the worst persecutors of Christ.

John 10:9, NRSV.\n\nTruth is an active, working principle, molding heart and life so\n\nthat there is a constant upward movement, climbing the ladder Jacob\n\nsaw, to the Lord above the ladder. In every step of climbing, the will\n\nis obtaining a new spring of action.... The glory of God revealed\n\nabove the ladder can be appreciated only by the progressive climber,\n\nwho is ever attracted higher, to nobler aims that Christ reveals. All\n\nthe faculties of mind and body must be enlisted....\n\nTo make our calling and election sure requires far greater dili-\n\ngence than many are giving to this important matter. “For if ye do\n\nthese things” live on the plan of addition, growing in grace and the\n\nknowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ—ye shall mount up, step by\n\nstep, the ladder Jacob saw, and “ye shall never fall.” ...\n\nLet us consider this ladder that was presented to Jacob. The\n\nhuman race was cut off from intercourse [communication] with God.\n\nThey mightlookata paradise lostbutcouldsee no means ofentering\n\nit and holding communion with heaven. The sin of Adam cut off\n\nall intercourse between heaven and earth. Up to the moment Adam\n\nand Eve transgressed God’s law there had been free communion\n\nbetween earth and heaven.

But the transgression of God’s law broke up this\n\npath, and the human race was separated from God.\n\nAs soon as Satan seduced our first parents to disobedience of\n\nGod’s holy law, every link that bound earth to heaven and the human\n\nrace to the infinite God seemed broken. Humans might look to\n\nheaven, but how could they attain it? But joy to the world!

And, behold, the Lord stood\n\nabove it, and said ... the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I\n\ngive it, and to thy seed. Genesis 28:12, 13.\n\nThe ladder is the medium of communication between God and\n\nthe human race. Through the mystic ladder the gospel was preached\n\nto Jacob. As the ladder stretched from earth, reaching to the highest\n\nheavens, and the glory of God was seen above the ladder, so Christ\n\nin His divine nature reached immensity and was one with the Father.\n\nAs the ladder, though its top penetrated into heaven, had its base\n\nupon the earth, so Christ, though [He was] God, clothed His divinity\n\nwithhumanityandwas in the world“foundin fashion as a man.” The\n\nladder would be useless if it rested not on the earth or if it reached\n\nnot to the heavens.\n\nGod appeared in glory above the ladder, looking down with\n\ncompassion on erring, sinful Jacob, addressing to him words of\n\nencouragement. It is through Christ that the Father beholds sinful\n\nhuman beings. The ministering angels were communicating to the\n\ninhabitants of the earth through the medium of the ladder. The only\n\nway that people can be saved is by clinging to Christ.\n\nWe ascend to heaven by climbing the ladder—the whole height\n\nof Christ’s work—step by step. There must be a holding fast to\n\nChrist, a climbing up by the merits of Christ. To let go is to cease to\n\nclimb, to fall, to perish....\n\nThe question with men and women gazing heavenward is How\n\ncan I obtain the mansions for the blessed? It is by being a partaker\n\nof the divine nature. It is by escaping the “corruption that is in the\n\nworld through lust.” It is by entering into the holiest by the blood of\n\nJesus, laying hold of the hope set before you in the gospel.... It is by\n\nbeing in Christ and yet led by Christ, by believing and working—\n\n186\n\nChristIsOurOnlyLadderToHeaven,March 22 187\n\ntrusting in Jesus, yet working upon the plan of addition, holding on\n\nto Christ and constantly mounting upward toward God....\n\nWe point you to the mansions Christ is preparing for all those\n\nwho love Him.

Genesis 32:26.\n\nTo tell tempted souls of their guilt in no way inspires them with\n\na determination to do better.... Hold up before them the possibilities\n\nthat are theirs. Point them to the heights to which they may attain.\n\nHelp them to take hold upon the mercy of the Lord, to trust in His\n\nforgiving power. Jesus is waiting to clasp them by the hand, waiting\n\nto give them power to live a noble, virtuous life.\n\nGod often brings people to a crisis to show them their own\n\nweakness and to point them to the Source of strength. If they pray\n\nand watch unto prayer, fighting bravely, their weak points will be-\n\ncome their strong points. Jacob’s experience contains many valuable\n\nlessons for us. God taught Jacob that in his own strength he could\n\nnever gain the victory, that he must wrestle with God for strength\n\nfrom above.\n\nAll night Jacob wrestled with the Angel. Finally the strong\n\nwrestlerwas weakenedby a touchon his thigh. He was now disabled\n\nand suffering the keenest pain, but he would not loose his hold.\n\nAll penitent and broken, he clung to the Angel, ... pleading for a\n\nblessing. He must have the assurance that his sin was pardoned. His\n\ndetermination grew stronger, his faith more earnest and persevering,\n\nuntil the very last. The Angel tried to release Himself; He urged,\n\n“Let me go, for the day breaketh,” but Jacob answered, “I will not\n\nlet thee go, except thou bless me.”\n\nHad this been a boastful, presumptuous confidence, Jacob would\n\nhave been instantly destroyed; but his was the assurance of one who\n\nconfesses his own unworthiness, yet trusts to the faithfulness of\n\na covenant-keeping God.... Through humiliation, repentance, and\n\nself-surrender this sinful, erring mortal prevailed with the Majesty\n\nof heaven. He had fastened his trembling grasp on the promises of\n\n188\n\nValuableLessonsInJacob’sExperience,March 23 189\n\nGod, and the heart of infinite love could not turn away the sinner’s\n\nplea.\n\nAs an evidence that Jacob had been forgiven, his name was\n\nchanged from one that was a reminder of his sin to one that com-\n\nmemorated his victory. “Thy name,” said the Angel, “shall be called\n\nno more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God\n\nand with men, and hast prevailed.”\n\nShall we obtain strength from God, and win victory after victory,\n\nor shall we try in our own strength, and at last fall back defeated,\n\nworn out by vain efforts? Let us, by unreserved surrender to God,\n\nobtain the power that everyone must have who conquers in the battle\n\nagainst evil.—Manuscript 2, 1903."

His mother being\n\ndead, his affections clung the more closely to the father, and Jacob’s\n\nheart was bound up in this child of his old age....\n\nBut even this affection was to become a cause of trouble and\n\nsorrow. Jacob unwisely manifested his preference for Joseph, and\n\nthis excited the jealousy of his other sons.... The father’s injudicious\n\ngift to Joseph of a costly coat, or tunic, such as was usually worn\n\nby persons of distinction, seemed to them another evidence of his\n\npartiality....

But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife ...\n\n:how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?\n\nGenesis 39:7-9.\n\nJoseph, in the providence of God, was deprived of his happy\n\nhome and the teachings and example of his God-fearing father, and\n\nhis lot was cast in a family of dark heathen. There his virtue was\n\nseverely tested. It is always a critical period in a young man’s life\n\nwhen he is separated from home influences and wise counsels and\n\nenters upon new scenes and trying tests....\n\nGod was with Joseph in his new home. He was in the path of\n\nduty, suffering wrong butnotdoing wrong. He therefore hadthe love\n\nand protection of God, for he carried his religious principles into\n\neverything he undertook. What a difference there was in Joseph’s\n\ncase and the case of young people who apparently force their way\n\ninto the very field of the enemy, exposing themselves to the fierce\n\nassaults of Satan. Joseph suffered for righteousness’ sake, while the\n\ntrials of others are of their own procuring. Joseph did not conceal\n\nhis religion or manly piety to avoid persecution.\n\nThe Lord prospered Joseph, but in the midst of his prosperity\n\ncame the darkest adversity. The wife of his master was a licentious\n\nwoman, one who urged his steps to take hold on hell. Would Joseph\n\nyield his moral gold of character to the seductions of a corrupt\n\nwoman? Would he remember that the eye of God was upon him?\n\nFew temptations are more dangerous or more fatal to young men\n\nthan the temptation of sensuality, and none, if yielded to, will prove\n\nso decidedly ruinous to soul and body for time and eternity. The\n\nwelfare of his entire future was suspended upon the decision of a\n\nmoment. Joseph calmly cast his eyes to heaven for help, slipped off\n\nhis loose outer garment, leaving it in the hand of his tempter, and\n\nwhile his eye was lighted with determined resolve in the place of\n\n202\n\nInnerCharacterRevealedInActions,March 30 203\n\nunholy passion, he exclaimed, “How can I do this great wickedness\n\nand sin against God?”...\n\nTrue religion extends to all the thoughts of the mind, penetrating\n\nto all the secret thoughts of the heart, to all the motives of action, to\n\nthe object and direction of the affections, to the whole framework of\n\nour lives. “Thou God seest me” will be the watchword, the guard of\n\nthe life....\n\nBut Joseph was a Christian.... He entered into the troubles of his\n\nfellow prisoners. He was cheerful, for he was a Christian gentleman.\n\nGod was preparing him under this discipline for a situation of great\n\nresponsibility, honor, and usefulness, and he was willing to learn ...\n\nthe lessons the Lord would teach him.—Letter 3, 1879 (Manuscript\n\nReleases 4:220-223)."

He rises grandly above every earthly\n\ninducement, and trusts himself wholly to God. He considered that\n\nhe was the Lord’s. While he was connected with the official interests\n\nof the king of Egypt, he was constantly studying the laws of God’s\n\ngovernment, and thus his faith grew.

He\n\nwas no longer planning to do a great work, but he became very\n\nhumble; the mists that were beclouding his mind were expelled,\n\nand he disciplined his mind to seek after God as his refuge. He\n\nrecognized the presence of God in his surroundings. All nature\n\nseemed to be filled with the presence of the Unseen One.

Exodus 2:15.\n\nMoses spent forty years as a shepherd of flocks to prepare him\n\nto understand himself, and to purify himself by emptying himself so\n\nthat the Lord could accomplish His will in him. The Lord does not\n\ntake for His workers mere machines in intellect or feelings. Both\n\nare essential to do the work, but these human elements of character\n\nmust be purged from defects, not by talking of the will of God, but\n\nby doing His will. If any will do His will, they shall know of the\n\ndoctrine. Moses was under training to God. He endured a long\n\nprocess of mental training to fit him to be leader of the armies of\n\nIsrael.\n\nInspiration will come to people of God’s appointment, but not to\n\nthose who retain a high idea of their own mental superiority. Every\n\nperson whom God will use to do His will must have humble ideas\n\nof self and must seek, in persevering earnestness, for light. God will\n\nnot require any person to become a novice and to sink down into a\n\nvoluntary humility, and become more and more incapacitated. God\n\ncalls upon everyone with whom He works to do the very highest\n\nkind of thinking and praying and hoping and believing.\n\nMany have, as had Moses, very much to unlearn in order to\n\nlearn the very lessons that they need to learn. Moses had need to\n\nbe self-trained by severest mental and moral discipline, and God\n\nwrought with him before he could be fitted to train others in mind\n\nand heart. He had been instructed in the Egyptian courts. Nothing\n\nwas left as unnecessary to train him to become a general of armies.\n\nThe false theories of the idolatrous Egyptians had been instilled into\n\nhis mind, and the influences surrounding him, and the things his\n\neyes looked upon, could not be easily shaken off or corrected.\n\n210\n\nGod’sMethodsOfTrainingDifferentFromMan’s,April 2 211\n\nThusitiswithmanywhohavehadafalsetraininginanyline.

Hebrews\n\n11:27.\n\nMoses was a child of God, chosen for a special work. Having\n\nbeen adopted by Pharaoh’s daughter, he was greatly honored by\n\nthose in the king’s court. As the king’s intended grandson, everyone\n\nwas intensely desirous of exalting him. They looked upon him as\n\nthe successor to the throne.\n\nMoses was a man of intelligence, and God in His providence\n\nplaced him where he could acquire knowledge and fitness for a great\n\nwork. He was thoroughly educated as a general. When he went out\n\nto meet the enemy, he was successful; and on his return from the\n\nbattle, his praises were sung by the whole army.\n\nNotwithstanding this, Moses constantly keptin mindthe factthat\n\nby his hand God would deliver the children of Israel. But although\n\nlearned among the Egyptians, he received in the service of Pharaoh\n\na certain mold that disqualified him for the wonderful work he was\n\nto do. This weakness was manifested when he visited his brethren\n\nand “spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew.” Moses took the case in\n\nhand and privately “slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.”...\n\nIn order that Moses might be fitted for his appointed work, the\n\nGod of heaven separated him from his former surroundings. He was\n\nto enter another school—the school of Providence. What a change\n\nhere took place in the life and employment of Moses! ...\n\nLooking at this experience from a human standpoint, observers\n\nwould pronounce it a splendid failure on the part of Moses. Instead\n\nof allowing this learned general, who was regarded as fully prepared\n\nto do his appointed work, to go ahead and accomplish that which it\n\nhad been foretold he should do, the Lord sent him into the mountains\n\nto obtain an education that would fit him to stand as the general of\n\nIsrael....\n\n212\n\nWeNeedAlwaysToLeanUponGod,April 3 213\n\nGod designed that Moses should stand out alone, leaning upon\n\nHis strong arm, that he should learn to pray and to believe....

But as soon\n\nas the pressure was removed, his unbelief returned and counteracted\n\nthe great light God had given. When he refused the evidence of\n\nthe first miracle, he sowed the seed of infidelity, which, left to its\n\nnatural course, produced a harvest after its own kind.

More than a million\n\npeople had been led out of the right course, as many of them thought,\n\ninto a valley hemmed in by mountains. Before them lay the Red Sea,\n\nand behind them, following fast after in pursuit, was Pharaoh’s host.\n\nIn the beginning of their march the children of Israel had been\n\nguided by a cloud. Ignorant and superstitious because of their long\n\nyears of bondage in a land of superstition, the people looked upon\n\nthis cloud with wonder.

A faith that is dependent on circumstances\n\nor surroundings, that lives only when everything goes smoothly, is\n\nnot a genuine faith.\n\nIn his trouble Moses cried to the Lord. This is what the children\n\nof Israel, so recently delivered, ought to have done. The Lord heard\n\nthe cry of His servant, against whom the people had said so many\n\nbitter things. He showed Moses a tree, “which when he had cast into\n\nthe waters, the waters were made sweet.” It was not the virtue of the\n\ntree that turned the bitter water to sweet; it was the power of Him\n\nwho was enshrouded in the pillar of cloud, the One who can do all\n\nthings....\n\nDid the people then appreciate and acknowledge God’s bless-\n\nings?

Did they have a praise service, as when they stood on the\n\n226\n\nOnlyGenuineFaithSurvivesWhenTested,April 10 227\n\nbanks of the Red Sea? We have no evidence that their faith was\n\nstrengthened by God’s mercy and grace and love toward them....\n\nWhen trial comes to prove us, when we cannot see an increase of\n\nprosperity and comfort before us, but a probable lessening of these\n\nthings, when there is a pressure necessitating sacrifice on the part\n\nof all, how shall we receive Satan’s insinuations that we are going\n\nto have a hard time, that everything is going to pieces, that there is\n\nsore trouble ahead of us? ...

It first originated in heaven with\n\nthe angel next highest in order to Jesus Christ. This exalted angel\n\nhad sympathizers who joined him in his rebellion. He, Satan, the\n\ngreat rebel, was turned out of heaven, and all his rebel sympathizers\n\nshared his fate. Since then it has been his special work to excite to\n\nrebellion all he can gain control over.\n\nSaidtheangel, “Rebellion willoccurupto the time ofthe closing\n\nof the work of the third angel’s message. Marvel not, neither be\n\ndiscouraged. He who conquered the leader in rebellion stands at\n\nthe head of this great work. Although Satan may exult and seem\n\nfor a time to triumph, the first great Conqueror has His eyes upon\n\nhim, and he can go no farther than He permits.

    "content": "If thou wilt forgive their sin—and if not, blot me, I pray thee,\n\nout of thy book which thou hast written. Exodus 32:32.\n\nAfter the children of Israel had listened at Sinai to the giving of\n\nthe Ten Commandments, they fell into idolatry, and the Lord was\n\nangry with them. He said to Moses, “Let me alone ... that I may\n\nconsume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.” But no; the\n\nman who had learned to seek after the lost sheep in the wilderness,\n\nwho had endured cold and storm rather than leave one sheep to\n\nperish, could not give up the people placed in his care. He pleaded\n\nwith God not to give them up, but to forgive their transgression....\n\nMoses declared, “If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up\n\nhence.” He no longer had any confidence in himself. His watchword\n\nwas The God of Israel is my Strength and my Leader. He received\n\nno adoration as did the kings of other nations. Repeatedly he told\n\nthe children of Israel that he was only what the God of Israel had\n\nmade him. In all the battles in which they obtained the victory, he\n\ntold them that they were not to claim the honor, for it was the God\n\nof Israel who gained the victory in their behalf.\n\nWhen the LordtoldMoses, “Mypresence shallgo withthee,” we\n\nmight think that this mighty man of God would have been satisfied.\n\nBut he was not. He still urged his petition. “He said, I beseech thee,\n\nshew me thy glory.” Was Moses rebuked for his presumption? ... He\n\n[God] took that mighty man of faith, and put him into a cleft in the\n\nrock, and there revealed to him His glory....\n\nWhen Moses returnedto the people, they couldnotlookupon his\n\ncountenance, forhe hadbeen talking withGod, andhis face reflected\n\nthe glory of God, which had been revealed to him. “The skin of his\n\nface shone.” When talking with the people, he was obliged to cover\n\nhis face with a veil.\n\n244\n\nMosesWasAnExampleOfGenuineHumility,April 19 245\n\nNot the pompous, boastful, unbelieving person, but the hum-\n\nble, faithful one is mighty in the sight of God. In order that He\n\nmay answer their prayers, the Lord desires His people to obtain an\n\nindividual experience. The nearer they come to Jesus Christ, the\n\ncloser their view of His loveliness and life, the more humble will\n\nbe their opinion of themselves. The lower their estimate of self, the\n\nmore distinct will be their views of the glory and majesty of God.\n\nWhen individuals claim that they are sanctified and holy, no clearer\n\nevidence is needed to show that they are not holy.—Manuscript 36,\n\n1885."

    "content": "All who have responsible positions must realize that they must\n\nfirst have power with God, in order that they may have power with\n\nthe people.... God listens to the appeal of His self-denying workers\n\nwho labor to advance His cause. He has even condescended to talk\n\nface-to-face with feeble mortals. He listens not only with patience\n\nbut with approval to the importunate prayers of those who really\n\nlong for His help.\n\nHis servant Moses felt his insufficiency for the great work before\n\nhim and pleaded, with an earnestness that seemed almost presump-\n\ntion, forthe presence of God to be with him. But instead of receiving\n\na reproof, the earnest pleader receives the reply “My presence shall\n\ngo with thee, and I will give thee rest”—an assurance that all his\n\nburdens may be rested upon God. But the mind of Moses is so\n\nburdened with the tremendous weight of the responsibilities resting\n\nupon him that he approaches still nearer to God, and his request is\n\npressed still further. The answer from God is “I will do this thing\n\nalso that thou hast spoken; for thou hast found grace in my sight,\n\nand I know thee by name.”\n\nEncouraged by his success, Moses ventures still further—a holy\n\nboldness he possesses, until it reaches a point that is incompre-\n\nhensible to poor, finite human beings. The servant of God has\n\nbeen, through prayer, approaching nearer and nearer to God, and\n\nnow [makes] a request such as no mortal human had ever dared to\n\nmake—“I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.” Will God thrust aside\n\nHis servant now for his apparent presumption? The third time the\n\nanswer comes, “I will make all my goodness pass before thee.” ...\n\nOh, what condescension on the part of God! That hand that\n\nmade the worlds takes the mighty man of faith and puts him in a\n\n246\n\nGodInvitesHolyBoldnessAsWeApproachHim,April 20 247\n\ncleft of the rock, that He may show him His glory, and make all His\n\ngoodness to pass before him....\n\nThe most brilliant intellect, the most earnest study, the highest\n\neloquence, can never be substituted for the wisdom and power of\n\nGod in those who are bearing the responsibilities connected with\n\nHis cause.... God has made every provision for workers to have the\n\nhelp that He alone can give. If they allow their work to hurry, drive,\n\nand confuse, so that they will have no time for devotional thought or\n\nfor prayer, they will make mistakes. If a standard is not lifted up by\n\nJesus Christ against Satan, he will overcome those who are engaged\n\nin the important work for this time.—Manuscript 6, 1879."

Satan could not touch\n\nthe head, the reasoning faculties, the eyes of the mind; but he could\n\nmake things that the outward eye looked upon appear in accordance\n\nwith his subtle working.... Aaron and Miriam became one in mind.\n\nThey communicated with one another and they said, “Hath the Lord\n\nindeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us?”\n\nMark that which follows: “And the Lord heard it.” The Lord hears\n\nmany things human beings say, and He understands the current\n\nof evil started into intense activity by words spoken in secret.

Hear His testimony;\n\nthe words come sounding down along the lines to our time, evidenc-\n\ning that the mind of God is not in agreement with the thoughts of\n\nunsanctified humans. “(Now the man Moses was very meek, above\n\nall the men which were upon the face of the earth.) ... And the Lord\n\ncame down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the\n\ntabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.\n\n“And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among\n\nyou, I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and\n\n248\n\nHeavenlyObserversWitnessEveryWordSpoken,April 21 249\n\nwill speak unto him in a dream.

With him will I speak mouth to mouth....\n\nAnd the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam\n\nbecame leprous, white as snow.”...\n\nBecause Aaron and Miriam were honored with a part in the\n\nwork, they thought they were equal to Moses, and were indeed a\n\nvery essential part of the great whole. They felt that credit should\n\nbe given to them and that Moses should not have all the honor.

But it showed\n\na lack of faith for the spies to speak of the Israelites thus in com-\n\nparison with the people they had seen in Canaan. The children of\n\nIsrael had on their side the mighty powers of heaven. The One who,\n\nenshrouded in the pillar of cloud, had led them through the wilder-\n\nness was fighting for them.

    "content": "My servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and\n\nhath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto\n\nhe went; and his seed shall possess it. Numbers 14:24.\n\nThe whole of the Christian world is involved in the great conflict\n\nof faith and unbelief. All will take sides. Some apparently may not\n\nengage in the conflict on either side. They may not appear to take\n\nsides against the truth, but they do not come out boldly for Christ\n\nthrough fear of losing property or suffering reproach; all such are\n\nnumbered with the enemies of God.\n\nMorality cannot be separated from religion. Not all conservative\n\ntradition received from educated persons and from the writings of\n\noutstanding people of the past are a safe guide for us in these last\n\ndays, for the great struggle before us is such as the world has never\n\nseen....\n\nWe are not one of us safe, even with past experience, unless\n\nwe live as seeing Him who is invisible. Daily, hourly, we must be\n\nactuated by the principles of Bible truth—righteousness, mercy, and\n\nthe love of God. Any person who would have moral and intellectual\n\npower must draw from the Divine Source.\n\nAt every point and decision inquire, Is this the way of the Lord?\n\nWith your Bibles open before you, consult sanctified reason and a\n\ngood conscience. Your heart must be moved, your soul touched,\n\nyour reason and intellect awakened by the Spirit of God. The holy\n\nprinciples laid down in His Word will give light to the soul. I tell you\n\n... our true source of wisdom and virtue and power is in the cross\n\nof Calvary. Christ is the Author and Finisher of our faith. He says,\n\n“Without me ye can do nothing.” Jesus is the only sure guarantee for\n\nintellectual success and advancement.\n\nWe need to practice temperance in all things so that the taste\n\nmay be elevated, the appetite controlled, the passions subdued. The\n\n260\n\nTrueMoralandIntellectualPowerOriginatesWithGod,April 27 261\n\nLord Jesus can supply every grace. Love, joy, peace, long-suffering,\n\ngentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance—these are the\n\nfruits borne by the Christian tree....\n\nIf you would have divine enlightenment, go to the throne of\n\ngrace, and you will be answered from the seat of mercy. A compact\n\nwas entered into by the Father and the Son to save the world through\n\nChrist, who would give Himself that whosoever believeth in Him\n\nshould not perish, but have eternal life. No human power or angelic\n\npower could make such a covenant.—Manuscript 16, 1890."

    "content": "Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are\n\nholy. Numbers 16:3.\n\nWhile some under correction will acknowledge that they have\n\nbeen an injury to the cause, there are others who will charge with\n\nhaving an unkind spirit the one who has manifested true friend-\n\nship by pointing out their wrongs, and will either be impudent or\n\ndisrespectful to the reprover or will put on the disguise of injured\n\ninnocence. This martyr-like appearance is a specious hypocrisy and\n\nis calculated to deceive those who are easily blinded, who are always\n\nready to sympathize with the wrongdoer....\n\n[Korah, Dathan, and Abiram] complained and influenced the\n\npeople to stand with them in rebellion, and even after God stretched\n\nforth His hand and swallowed up the wrongdoers and the people fled\n\nto their tents in horror, their rebellion was not cured.\n\nThe depth of their disaffection was made manifest even under\n\nthe judgment of the Lord. The morning after the destruction of\n\nKorah, Dathan, and Abiram and their confederates, the people came\n\nto Moses and Aaron saying, “Ye have killed the people of the Lord.”\n\nFor this false charge on the servants of God thousands more were\n\nkilled, for there was in them sin, exultation, and presumptuous\n\nwickedness.\n\nShall the example presented in the history of the children of\n\nIsrael have any weight with us? Shall those who claim to believe the\n\ntruth be influenced to judge from their human feelings as did Israel?\n\nWhen the servants of God are called upon to do the disagreeable\n\nduty of correcting the erring, let not those upon whom the Lord has\n\nnot laid this burden stand between the offender and God. If you\n\ncannot see matters in the light in which they have been presented,\n\nhold your peace; let the arrows of the Almighty fall just where He\n\nhas directed they shall fall....\n\n262\n\nAcknowledgeCorrectionandProfitFromIt,April 28 263\n\nReproof and rebuke may, and will, come closer home to individ-\n\nuals than they dream of. God has His work in hand, and declarations\n\nwill be made that will test the faith and loyalty of the people of God.\n\nThere are those who have had great light, who are far from God,\n\nwho in heart are apostates....\n\nBut we may still rejoice in the fact that it is not yet too late for\n\nwrongs to be righted. Jesus is a risen, living Saviour, our Advocate\n\nin the courts of heaven. “And if any man sin, we have an advocate\n\nwith the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.” As soon as sinners\n\nsee their sins in the light of God’s Word, repent, and seek pardon\n\nwith contrition of soul, confessing their sins, the Lord hears and\n\nanswers.—Letter 12 a, 1893."

And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron,\n\nBecause ye believed me not, ye shall not bring this\n\ncongregation into the land. Numbers 20:10-12.\n\nIt would be the greatest folly in the world for any of us to take\n\ncredit to ourselves for any success we may have. The more humbly\n\nwe walk with God, the more will He manifest Himself to us to help\n\nus. The Lord never designed to send out His servants to do a work\n\nfor Him, with all the opposition of Satan and evil angels against\n\nthem, unless He gives them divine help. The reason that we do\n\nnot have greater success in the work is that we depend on our own\n\nefforts rather than upon the help God will give us.... Consider how\n\nSatan rules his agents and works through them to do his work of\n\ndarkness and deception. It is your privilege to believe that Jesus will\n\nwork more earnestly for you so that you can do His work....\n\nAll heaven is interested in the work of those who are to be saved\n\nin the kingdom of God. “Without me,” says Christ, “ye can do\n\nnothing.” Therefore there is not one iota of glory that we can take to\n\nourselves. Notwithstanding you may feel your weakness, yet you\n\nmay link yourself to the mighty God. I know that I am nothing, but\n\nJesus is mighty to save. I can do nothing, but Jesus can do great\n\nthings. God wants me in the work, but my efforts will be useless\n\nwithout His help.\n\nThe constant cry of Israel was “It is Moses that has done this,”\n\nand they did not keep God in view. God had a lesson to teach His\n\npeople, and when Moses ventured to take the glory to himself, God\n\nshowed the people that it was not Moses but God who had done\n\nthe work. At last came the word to Moses, “Thou shalt not go into\n\nthe holy land.” The Lord demonstrated to the Israelitish host whose\n\nhand it was that was leading them.\n\n264\n\nToGod,NotSelf,BetheGlory,April 29 265\n\nWhen we feel our utter nothingness, it is then that Christ sees\n\nit is time for Him to give us His Spirit. He will clothe us with His\n\nsalvation when we give the whole credit and glory of the work to\n\nHim. The Lord help us, my dear brethren and sisters, to learn the\n\nprecious lessons in the school of Christ. These lessons are meekness\n\nand lowliness of heart. Some never learn these lessons. They work\n\nand work in themselves, and they do not understand who is the\n\nSource of their strength and power.—Manuscript 8, 1886."

Jude 9.\n\nSatan contended earnestly for the body of Moses. Again he\n\nsought to enter into controversy with Christ in regard to the injustice\n\nof God’s law, and with deceiving power reiterated his false state-\n\nments about not being fairly treated. His accusations were such that\n\nChrist did not bring against him the record of the cruel work he had\n\ndone in heaven by deceptive misrepresentation, the falsehoods he\n\nhad told in Eden that led to Adam’s transgression, and the stirring up\n\nof the worst passions of the hosts of Israel to incite them to murmur\n\nand rebel until Moses lost command of himself.... Christ did not\n\nretaliate in answerto Satan. He broughtno railing accusation against\n\nhim, but raised Moses from the dead and took him to heaven.\n\nHere for the first time the power of Christ was exercised to break\n\nthe power of Satan and give life to the dead. Here began His work\n\nof making alive that which was dead. Thus He testified that He was\n\nindeed the Resurrection and the Life, that He had power to ransom\n\nthose whom Satan had made his captives, that although people die\n\nthey will live again. The question had been asked, “If a man die,\n\nshall he live again?” (Job 14:14). The question was now answered.\n\nThis act was a great victory over the powers of darkness. This\n\ndisplay of power was an incontrovertible testimony to the supremacy\n\nof the Son of God. Satan had not expected that the body would\n\nbe raised to life after death. He had concluded that the sentence\n\n“Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return” gave him undisputed\n\npossession of the bodies of the dead. Now he saw that he would be\n\ndespoiled of his prey, that mortals would live again after death.\n\nAfter Moses was raised to life, the heavenly gates of Paradise\n\nwere opened, and Jesus passed in with His captive.

Joshua 6:20.\n\nInobediencetothedivinecommandJoshuamarshaledthearmies\n\nof Israel. No assault was to be made. They were simply to make the\n\ncircuitofthe city, bearing the arkofGodandblowing upon trumpets.\n\nFirst came the warriors, a body of chosen men, not now to conquer\n\nby their own skill and prowess, but by obedience to the directions\n\ngiven them from God. Seven priests with trumpets followed. Then\n\nthe ark of God, surrounded by a halo of divine glory, was borne\n\nby priests clad in the dress denoting their sacred office. The army\n\nof Israel followed, each tribe under its standard.... No sound was\n\nheard but the tread of that mighty host and the solemn peal of the\n\ntrumpets, echoing among the hills andresounding throughthe streets\n\nof Jericho....\n\nFor six days the host of Israel made the circuit of the city. The\n\nseventh day came, and with the first dawn of light, Joshua marshaled\n\nthe armies ofthe Lord. Now they were directedto marchseven times\n\naround Jericho, and at a mighty peal from the trumpets to shout with\n\na loud voice, for God had given them the city....\n\nAs the seventh circuit was completed, the long procession\n\npaused. The trumpets, which for an interval had been silent, now\n\nbroke forth in a blast that shook the very earth. The walls of solid\n\nstone, withtheirmassivetowersandbattlements, totteredandheaved\n\nfrom their foundations, and with a crash fell in ruin to the earth. The\n\ninhabitants of Jericho were paralyzed with terror, and the hosts of\n\nIsrael marched in and took possession of the city.\n\nThe Israelites had not gained the victory by their own power;\n\nthe conquest had been wholly the Lord’s; and as the firstfruits of\n\nthe land, the city, with all that it contained, was to be devoted as a\n\n282\n\nVictoriesAreWonByGod’sPowerNotOurs,May 7 283\n\nsacrifice to God.... Only faithful Rahab, with her household, was\n\nspared, in fulfillment of the promise of the spies....\n\nThe utter destruction of the people of Jericho was but a fulfill-\n\nment of the commands previously given through Moses concerning\n\nthe inhabitants of Canaan: “Thou shalt smite them, and utterly de-\n\nstroy them.”... To many these commands seem to be contrary to the\n\nspirit of love and mercy enjoined in other portions of the Bible, but\n\nthey were in truth the dictates of infinite wisdom and goodness....\n\nThe Canaanites had abandoned themselves to the foulest and most\n\ndebasing heathenism, and it was necessary that the land should be\n\ncleared of what would so surely prevent the fulfillment of God’s\n\ngracious purposes.—Patriarchs and Prophets, 488-492."

Philippians 3:14.\n\nThroughout life we will have our conflicts with the powers of\n\ndarkness and will be obtaining precious victories. Our eyes must be\n\nkept fixed upon the mark of the prize. When Joshua went up from\n\nthe Jordan to take Jericho, he met a majestic Being, and at once chal-\n\nlenged Him: “Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?” The answer\n\nwas “As captain of the host of the Lord am I now come.... Loose thy\n\nshoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy.”\n\nNot Joshua, the leader of Israel, but Christ Himself, accomplished\n\nthe work of taking Jericho.\n\nThese were the lessons continually given the children of Israel.\n\nBy directing their attention to the God of heaven, Christ taught them\n\nnot to take the glory to themselves. Let us not cherish self-exaltation.\n\nWhen we begin to think we are something, let us remember that we\n\nhave nothing different from or better than other mortals, except what\n\nGod has given us.\n\nWhen in need, bear in mind our relation to the children of Israel.\n\nTheir history is clearly traced by the pen of inspiration. We are not\n\nto imitate their example of murmuring and repining. God placed\n\nupon the lips of Moses no words of condemnation. In this respect\n\nthey were separate and distinct from other nations.\n\nIn accepting the religion of Jesus Christ, many seem to think\n\nthat they are taking a downward step. These are in need of stepping\n\ndown from their self-esteem and self-righteousness, and humbling\n\nthemselves before God. But those who place themselves in connec-\n\ntion with the living God, as His sons and daughters, are taking steps\n\nupward....\n\nWe are to talk of heaven and heavenly things, keeping ourselves\n\nin a position of supplication before God. It is not safe for any of\n\nus to feel that we are where our feet cannot slip, but we should feel\n\n284\n\nOurEyesMustBeFixedOnJesus,May 8 285\n\nthat the ground whereon we stand is holy. Cleanse the soul temple\n\nof its defilement, that Christ may come in and reign supreme. By\n\nbeholding Jesus Christ, we shall grow up into His likeness. The\n\nmore closely we are connected with Him, the more clearly we shall\n\nsee our imperfections.... In order to know the power and strength of\n\ntrue godliness, we must hide in Jesus, dedicating ourselves to Him\n\nwithout reserve.... Fully dedicate your strength, your mind, all your\n\nabilities, to God. Wherever He places you, however humble may be\n\nyour position, work with fidelity.—Manuscript 36, 1885."

John 16:33.\n\nOur Lord is cognizant of the conflict of His people in these\n\nlast days with the satanic agencies combined with evil people who\n\nneglect and refuse this great salvation. With the greatest simplicity\n\nand candor, our Saviour, the mighty General of the armies of heaven,\n\ndoes not conceal the stern conflict that they will experience. He\n\npoints out the dangers, He shows us the plan of the battle and the\n\nhard and hazardous work to be done, and then lifts His voice before\n\nentering the conflict, [telling us] to count the cost while at the same\n\ntime [encouraging] all to take up the weapons of their warfare and\n\nexpect the heavenly host to compose the armies to war in defense of\n\ntruth and righteousness.\n\nHuman weakness shall find supernatural strength and help in ev-\n\nery stern conflict to do the deeds of Omnipotence, and perseverance\n\nin faith and perfect trust in God will ensure success. While the vast\n\nconfederacy of evil is arrayed against His people He bids them to\n\nbe brave and strong and fight valiantly, for they have a heaven to\n\nwin, and they have more than an angel in their ranks—the mighty\n\nGeneral of armies leads on the armies of heaven. As on the occasion\n\nof the taking of Jericho, not one of the armies of Israel could boast\n\nof exercising their finite strength to overthrow the walls of this city,\n\nbut the Captain of the Lord’s host planned that battle in the greatest\n\nsimplicity, that the Lord God alone should receive the glory and\n\nmortals should not be exalted. God has promised us all power.\n\nIt is not great talent that we want now, it is humble hearts and\n\ndirect, consecrated, personal effort, watching, praying, working\n\nwith all perseverance.... Christ has sent His representative, the Holy\n\nSpirit, surrounding His living agents who are employed to pierce the\n\nignorance with the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness. His\n\n286\n\nFaithAndTrustInChristAssuresTrueSuccess,May 9 287\n\nvoice will give assurance, “Lo I am with you alway, even unto the\n\nend of the world.” The fact is to be ever kept before us that we are\n\ncarrying forward the warfare in the presence of an invisible world.\n\nWe are all to calmly depend upon God as we look upon the\n\nobstacles and stubborn unbelief and consider all the risks that must\n\nbe ventured, and then listen to the voice of Jesus: “Be of good cheer;\n\nI have overcome the world.” Yes, Christ is conqueror. He is our\n\nLeader, our Captain, and we can advance to the victory. Because He\n\nlives, we shall live also.—Letter 51, 1895."

Joshua 7:13.\n\nThose who make a profession of Christianity and yet fail to\n\nhave true piety are false lights, false signboards pointing in a wrong\n\ndirection.... They fail to bring the principles of the truth they profess\n\nto believe into their life practices, and regard their sins and errors\n\nas trifling things. When Achan stole the golden wedge and the\n\nBabylonish garment, he also thought it was a trifling matter....\n\nBecause of this one man’s sin, the presence of the Lord was\n\nwithdrawn from the armies of Israel. The Lord would not serve with\n\ntheir sins. When the children of Israel went up against Ai, they were\n\ndefeated....\n\nWhen they came back in disgrace, overcome by the enemy,\n\n“Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before\n\nthe ark of the Lord until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel,\n\nand put dust upon their heads. And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord God,\n\nwherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver\n\nus into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we\n\nhad been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan! O Lord, what\n\nshall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies! For\n\nthe Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and\n\nshall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and\n\nwhat wilt thou do unto thy great name?”\n\nYou can see by the prayer of Joshua, if you have spiritual dis-\n\ncernment, that that which was esteemed by Achan as a very little\n\nthing was the cause of great anguish and sorrow to the responsible\n\nmen of Israel.... Achan, the guilty party, did not feel the burden. He\n\ntook it very coolly....\n\nBefore the people had gone to take Jericho, they had been in-\n\nstructed what course to pursue. Joshua had said, “The city shall be\n\n288\n\nGod’sViewOfASupposed“Small”Sin,May 10 289\n\naccursed, even it, and all that are therein.”... Achan had heard all\n\nthis charge, but he coveted the accursed thing of Jericho, appointed\n\nto destruction. He was even ready to steal the gold and silver that\n\nwere to be consecrated to God and put them into the treasury of his\n\nhouse....\n\nHear the words from the lips of Jesus Christ, who was en-\n\nshrouded in the cloudy pillar: “Neither will I be with you any more,\n\nexcept ye destroy the accursed from among you.”—Letter 13, 1893\n\n(The Youth’s Instructor, January 25, 1894)."

Joshua 7:15.\n\nThe Lord did not specify who was the guilty party, but He gave\n\ndirections as to what was to be done. He said, “In the morning\n\ntherefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall\n\nbe, that the tribe which the Lord taketh shall come according to the\n\nfamilies thereof; and the family which the Lord shall take shall come\n\n... man by man.”\n\nIn thus sifting the matter to the bottom, the Lord reveals the fact\n\nthat He is acquainted with the hidden things of dishonesty, however\n\npeople may think that they are hidden. In all the transaction, Achan\n\nmanifested a determination not to acknowledge his sin; but now the\n\nLord fastened his sin upon him. Had Joshua declared Achan’s sin,\n\nmany might have sympathized with the guilty one as he protested\n\nthat he was innocent, and they might, in their human judgment, have\n\nthought he was misused and maltreated. It is thus that many do\n\ntoday when people are reproved for sin, for they drop God out of\n\ntheir reckoning. This is the reason that Joshua addressed Achan as\n\nhe did. He said, “My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of\n\nIsrael, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou\n\nhast done; hide it not from me.”\n\nThe LordhadtoldJoshua justwhatAchan haddone, butso many\n\nare led by human sympathy, and the wrongdoer is so often excused,\n\nthat the Lord meant to give Israel a lesson that should also be of\n\nbenefit to us in our day. Therefore Joshua entreated the young man\n\nto tell him what he had done....\n\nHad punishment come upon Achan before he had with his own\n\nlips made confession of his wrong, the people, who were naturally\n\nready to rebel, would have charged Joshua with dealing harshly with\n\n290\n\nNoSinCanBeHiddenFromGod,May 11 291\n\nthe young man, and would have denounced him as unmerciful in\n\napportioning so dreadful a punishment....\n\nAchan confessed, and said, “Indeed I have sinned against the\n\nLord God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done: When I saw\n\namong the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred\n\nshekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I\n\ncoveted them ... and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of\n\nmy tent, and the silver under it.”...\n\n“And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with\n\nfire, after they had stoned them with stones.”—Letter 13, 1893 (The\n\nYouth’s Instructor, January 25, 1894; The Youth’s Instructor, Febru-\n\nary 1, 1894)."

Joshua 23:3.\n\nThe wars of conquest ended, Joshua had withdrawn to the peace-\n\nful retirement of his home at Timnath-serah.... The Lord had im-\n\npressed His faithful servant to do as Moses had done before him—to\n\nrecapitulate the history of the people, and call to mind the terms that\n\nthe Lord had made with them when He gave them His vineyard.\n\nSeveral years had passed since the people had settled in their\n\npossessions, and already could be seen cropping out the same evils\n\nthat had heretofore brought judgments upon Israel. As Joshua felt\n\nthe infirmities of age stealing upon him, he was filled with anxiety\n\nfor the future of his people. It was with more than a father’s interest\n\nthat he addressed them, as they gathered once more about him....\n\nAlthough the Canaanites had been subdued, they still possessed\n\na considerable portion of the land promised to Israel, and Joshua\n\nexhorted the people not to settle down at ease and forget the Lord’s\n\ncommands to utterly dispossess these idolatrous nations....\n\nJoshua appealed to the people themselves as witnesses that, so\n\nfar as they had complied with the conditions, God had faithfully\n\nfulfilled His promises to them.... Satan deceives many with the\n\nplausible theory that since God’s love for His people is so great, He\n\nwill excuse sin in them; that while the threatenings of God’s Word\n\nare to serve a certain purpose in His moral government, they are\n\nnever to be literally fulfilled. But in His dealings with His creatures,\n\nGod has maintained the principles of righteousness by revealing sin\n\nin its true character—by demonstrating that its sure result is misery\n\nand death. The unconditional pardon of sin never has been and never\n\nwill be. Such pardon would show the abandonment of the principles\n\nof righteousness that are the very foundation of the government of\n\nGod....\n\n292\n\nGodFaithfullyFulfillsHisPromises,May 12 293\n\nGod has faithfully pointed out the results of sin, and if these\n\nwarnings are not true, how can we be sure that His promises will be\n\nfulfilled? That so-called benevolence, which would set aside justice,\n\nis not benevolence, but weakness....\n\nAfter presenting the goodness of God toward Israel, Joshua\n\ncalled upon the people, in the name of Jehovah, to choose whom\n\nthey would serve.... Joshua desired to lead them to serve God, not\n\nby compulsion, but willingly. Love to God is the very foundation\n\nof religion. To engage in His service merely from the hope of re-\n\nward or the fear of punishment would avail nothing. Open apostasy\n\nwould not be more offensive to God than hypocrisy and mere formal\n\nworship.—Manuscript 135, 1899 (The Youth’s Instructor, June 13,\n\n1901; The Youth’s Instructor, June 20, 1901)."

Behold, to obey\n\nis better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. 1\n\nSamuel 15:22.\n\nThe last days are upon us, and Satan is working with all his\n\nhellish arts to deceive and destroy souls. Reproofs by testimony\n\nare met almost universally, by the ones corrected and reproved,\n\nwith “I believe the testimonies, but I do not understand them.” The\n\nLord has corrected their wrong ways in order to save them from\n\nunhappiness, deception, and ruin; but they pass on the same as if\n\nlight and warnings had never come to them.

God had laid upon him the burden of Saul and the\n\nburden of this terrible message that he must bear to the monarch.\n\nSinners seldom feel right in regard to reproof.

But she told not her husband Nabal. 1 Samuel\n\n25:19.\n\nThe Lord would have the wife render respect unto her husband,\n\nbut always as it is fit in the Lord. In the character of Abigail, the\n\nwife of Nabal, we have an illustration of womanhood after the order\n\nof Christ, while her husband illustrates what a man may become\n\nwho yields himself to the control of Satan. When David was a\n\nfugitive from the face of Saul, he had camped near the possessions\n\nof Nabal and had protected the flocks and the shepherds of this man\n\nfrom all depredation while in Carmel. In a time of need David\n\nsent messengers to Nabal with a courteous message, asking for\n\nfood for himself and his men, and Nabal answered with insolence,\n\nreturning evil for good and refusing to share his abundance with his\n\nneighbors....\n\nNabal accused David and his men falsely in order to justify\n\nhimself in his selfishness, and represented David and his followers\n\nas runaway slaves.... One of the young men in the employ of Nabal,\n\nfearing that evil results would follow Nabal’s insolence, came and\n\nstated the case to Nabal’s wife, knowing that she had a different\n\nspirit from her husband and was a woman of great discretion. He\n\nset forth the true character of Nabal as he presented the difficulties\n\nto her, saying, “Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt\n\ndo; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his\n\nhousehold: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to\n\nhim.”\n\nAbigail saw that something must be done to avert the result of\n\nNabal’s fault, and that she must take the responsibility of acting\n\nimmediately, without the counsel of her husband. She knew that it\n\nwould be useless to speak to him, for he would receive her propo-\n\nsition only with abuse and contempt. He would remind her that he\n\n302\n\nKindnessOvercomesSelfishness,May 17 303\n\nwas the lord of his household, that she was his wife and therefore in\n\nsubjection to him and must do as he should dictate.... She gathered\n\ntogether such stores as she thought best to conciliate the wrath of\n\nDavid, for she knew he was determined to avenge himself for the\n\ninsult he had received....\n\nAbigail’s course in this matter was one that God approved, and\n\nthe circumstance revealed in her a noble spirit and character.... Abi-\n\ngail met David with respect, showing him honor and deference,\n\nand pleaded her cause eloquently and successfully. While not ex-\n\ncusing her husband’s insolence, she still pleaded for his life. She\n\nalso revealed the fact that she was not only a discreet woman, but\n\na godly woman, acquainted with the works and ways of God in\n\nDavid.—Manuscript 17, 1891 (Manuscript Releases 21:213, 214)."

He declared that it had been his intention to destroy Nabal\n\nand his household, but that now he would refrain from vengeance,\n\nfor he believed that she had been sent by the Lord to prevent him\n\nfrom doing so great an evil. He promised that her request should be\n\never remembered, even when he should sit as ruler over Israel, and\n\nhe would never seek retaliation for the insult of Nabal.\n\nAlthough Nabal had refused the needy company of David and\n\nhis men, yet that very night he made an extravagant feast for himself\n\nand his riotous friends, and indulged in eating and drinking till he\n\nsank in drunken stupor. The next day after the effects of his drunken\n\ndebauch had somewhat passed away, his wife told him of how near\n\nhe had been to death, and of how the calamity had been averted....\n\nPalsied with horror, he sat down and never recovered from the shock.\n\nFrom this history we can see that there are circumstances under\n\nwhich it is proper for a woman to act promptly and independently,\n\nmoving with decision in the way she knows to be the way of the\n\nLord. The wife is to stand by the side of the husband as his equal,\n\nsharing all the responsibilities of life, rendering due respect to him\n\nwho has selected her for his life-long companion. “For the husband\n\nis the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and\n\nhe[referringtoChrist]isthesaviourofthebody,”orchurch....

If he has the mind of\n\n304\n\nFruitsOfASoftAnswer,May 18 305\n\nChrist he will not be a destroyerofthe body, but will be full of tender\n\nlove, seeking to reach the highest standard in Christ.

This instruction was to be carefully cherished as the Word\n\nof the Lord for all who should follow David as rulers of the peo-\n\nple.

Little space is\n\ngiven to recounting the virtues of even the best men and women who\n\nhave ever lived. This silence is not without purpose; it is not without\n\na lesson. All the good qualities that people possess are the gift of\n\nGod; their good deeds are performed by the grace of God through\n\nChrist....\n\nIt was the spirit of self-confidence and self-exaltation that pre-\n\nparedthewayforDavid’sfall.... Accordingtothecustomsprevailing\n\namong Eastern rulers, crimes not to be tolerated in subjects were\n\nuncondemned in the king; the monarch was not under obligation\n\nto exercise the same self-restraint as the subject. All this tended\n\nto lessen David’s sense of the exceeding sinfulness of sin.... As\n\nsoon as Satan can separate the soul from God, the only Source of\n\nstrength, he will seek to arouse the unholy desires of humanity’s\n\ncarnal nature....\n\nWhen in ease and self-security he let go his hold upon God,\n\nDavid yielded to Satan and brought upon his soul the stain of guilt....\n\nBathsheba, whose fatal beauty had proved a snare to the king, was\n\nthe wife ofUriahthe Hittite, one ofDavid’s bravestandmostfaithful\n\nofficers.... Every effort that David made to conceal his guilt proved\n\nunavailing. He had betrayed himself into the power of Satan....\n\nThere appeared but one way of escape, and in his desperation he\n\nwas hurried on to add murder to adultery....\n\nNathan the prophet was bidden to bear a message of reproof to\n\nDavid. It was a message terrible in its severity. To few sovereigns\n\ncould such a reproof be given but at the price of certain death to the\n\nreprover.... Appealing to David as the divinely appointed guardian\n\n308\n\nOneSinOftenForcesAnother,May 20 309\n\nof his people’s rights, the prophet repeated a story of wrong and\n\noppression that demanded redress....\n\nNathan fixed his eyes upon the king; then, lifting his right hand\n\nto heaven, he solemnly declared, “Thou art the man.” “Wherefore,”\n\nhe continued, “hast thou despised the commandment of the Lord, to\n\ndo evil in his sight?” The guilty may attempt, as David had done, to\n\nconceal their crime...; they may seek to bury the evil deed forever\n\nfromhumansightorknowledge; but“allthingsarenakedandopened\n\nunto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.”...\n\nThe prophet’s rebuke touched the heart of David; conscience\n\nwas aroused; his guilt appeared in all its enormity. His soul was\n\nbowed in penitence before God. With trembling lips he said, “I have\n\nsinned against the Lord.”—Patriarchs and Prophets, 717-722."

Psalm 32:1, 2,\n\nNRSV.\n\nMany commit the error of trying to define minutely the fine\n\npoints of distinction between justification and sanctification. Into\n\nthe definitions of these two terms they often bring their own ideas\n\nand speculations. Why try to be more minute than is Inspiration on\n\nthe vital question of righteousness by faith? Why try to work out\n\nevery minute point, as if the salvation of the soul depended upon all\n\nhaving exactly your understanding of this matter? All cannot see in\n\nthe same line of vision. You are in danger of making a world of an\n\natom, and an atom of a world.\n\nAs penitent sinners, contrite before God, discern Christ’s atone-\n\nment in their behalf, and accept this atonement as their only hope\n\nin this life and the future life, their sins are pardoned. This is jus-\n\ntification by faith. Every believing soul is to conform his or her\n\nwill entirely to God’s will, and keep in a state of repentance and\n\ncontrition, exercising faith in the atoning merits of the Redeemer,\n\nand advancing from strength to strength, from glory to glory. Pardon\n\nand justification are one and the same thing....\n\nJustification is the opposite of condemnation. God’s boundless\n\nmercy is exercised toward those who are wholly undeserving. He\n\nforgives transgressions and sins for the sake of Jesus, who has be-\n\ncome the propitiation for our sins. Through faith in Christ the guilty\n\ntransgressor is brought into favor with God and into the strong hope\n\nof life eternal....\n\nDavid was pardoned of his transgression because he humbled his\n\nheart before God in repentance and contrition of soul and believed\n\nthat God’s promise to forgive would be fulfilled. He confessed his\n\n314\n\nToReceiveGod’sPardonIsToReceiveHisJustification,May 23 315\n\nsin, repented, and was reconverted.

Psalm 77:11, 12.\n\nBe careful how you interpret Scripture. Read it with a heart\n\nopened to the entrance of God’s Word, and it will express Heaven’s\n\nlight, giving understanding unto the simple. This does not mean\n\nthe weak-minded but those who do not stretch themselves beyond\n\ntheir measure and ability in trying to be original and independent in\n\nreaching after knowledge above that which constitutes true knowl-\n\nedge....\n\nThe psalmist David in his experience had many changes of mind.\n\nAt times as he obtained views of God’s will and ways, he was highly\n\nexalted. Then as he caught sight of the reverse of God’s mercy and\n\nchangeless love, everything seemed to be shrouded in a cloud of\n\ndarkness.... When he meditated upon the difficulties and dangers of\n\nlife, they looked so forbidding that he thought himself abandoned\n\nby God because of his sins. He viewed his sin in such a strong light\n\nthat he exclaimed, “Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be\n\nfavourable no more?”\n\nAs he wept and prayed, he obtained a clearer view of the charac-\n\nter and attributes of God, and being educated by heavenly agencies,\n\nhe decided that his ideas of God’s justice and severity were exagger-\n\nated.... As David considered His [God’s] pledges and promises to\n\nthem [Israel], knowing they were for all who need them as much as\n\nfor Israel, he appropriated them to himself....\n\nAs David appropriated these promises and privileges to himself,\n\nhe decided that he would no longer be hasty in judgment, becoming\n\ndiscouraged and casting himself down in helpless despair. His soul\n\ntook courage as he contemplated the general character of God as\n\ndisplayed in His teaching, His forbearance, His surpassing greatness\n\n320\n\nOurIdeasOfGodAreBasedOnOurExperiences,May 26 321\n\nand mercy, and he saw that the works and wonders of God are to\n\nhave no confined application.\n\nBut again David’s experience changed. As he saw that trans-\n\ngressors and sinners were allowed to receive blessings and favors,\n\nwhile those who really loved God were compassed with difficulties\n\nand perplexities that the open sinner did not have, he thought that\n\nGod’s ways were not equal....“For I was envious at the foolish, when\n\nI saw the prosperity of the wicked.... They are not in trouble as other\n\nmen.”\n\nDavid could not understand this till he went into the sanctuary\n\nof God, and then, he says, “Understood I their end.” “Surely thou\n\ndidst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into\n\ndestruction.... It is good for me to draw near to God.”—Manuscript\n\n4, 1896."

The nation of God’s choice had been\n\ngreatly favored; they dwelt in costly houses while they still wor-\n\nshiped God in the curtained tabernacle. Here the Shekinah, the\n\nvisible emblem of God’s presence, dwelt between the cherubim, and\n\nout of the perfection of beauty God shined....\n\nThere have been times when it seemed necessary to worship God\n\nin very humble places; but the Lord did not withhold His Spirit nor\n\nrefuse His presence because of this. It was the best His people could\n\ndo at the time, and if they worshiped Him in Spirit and in truth, He\n\nnever reproved or condemned their efforts....\n\nThe Lord reminded David of the lowly position he was in when\n\nHe called him and entrusted him with great responsibilities, and He\n\nwould have him ever bear in mind that his prosperity and success\n\ncame through the blessing of God and not through any inherited\n\ngoodness that he possessed.

But now the nation had ended their pilgrimage and\n\nobtained a permanent location. David looked around him upon the\n\ncostly buildings of cedar, the homes of the inhabitants settled in\n\nthe goodly land of Canaan, and conceived the idea that a temple\n\nshould be built, more worthy for the residence of God. The site of\n\nthe building was indicated and the most complete instructions were\n\ngiven, and Solomon entered upon the great work....\n\nThe people that built the temple were many and the house that\n\nthey built was large and grand; and the Lord God of heaven honored\n\nthem because they had built Him a sanctuary where they could\n\nmeet to worship Him.

    "content": "If any of you is lacking in wisdom, ask God, who gives to all\n\ngenerously and ungrudgingly, and it will be given you. James\n\n1:5, NRSV.\n\nAll the wisdom that people possess is God’s gift, and He can\n\nand will impart wisdom to every person who asks it of Him in\n\nfaith. Solomon sought wisdom from God, and it was given him in\n\nlarge measure. But how did the universe of heaven look upon him\n\nwhen he perverted that wisdom and employed God’s great and holy\n\ngift to exalt himself? God chose him to build the temple, but how\n\nhe perverted the sacred trust! He leagued himself with idolatrous\n\nnations. Thus he, who atthe dedication ofthe temple hadprayedthat\n\ntheir hearts might be undividedly given to the Lord, himself began\n\nto separate his heart from God. He imperiled his soul’s interest by\n\nthe formation of friendships with the Lord’s enemies.\n\nWhat carefulness should be exercised in the formation of friend-\n\nship! Companionship with the world will surely lower the standard\n\nof religious principle. Solomon’s heathen wives turned away his\n\nheart from God. His finer sensibilities were blunted, and he became\n\nhardhearted, for he lost his sympathy for humankind and his love\n\nfor God. His conscience was seared, and his rule became tyranny.\n\nSolomon prepared the way for his own ruin when he sought for\n\nwise artisans from other nations to build the temple. God had been\n\nthe educator of His people, and He designed that they should stand\n\nin His wisdom, and with His imparted talents they should be second\n\nto none. If they had the clean hands, the pure heart, and the noble,\n\nsanctified purpose, the Lord would communicate to them His grace.\n\nBut Solomon looked to worldlings instead of God, and he found\n\nhis supposed strength to be weakness. He brought to Jerusalem the\n\nleaven of the evil influences that were perpetuated in polygamy and\n\nidolatry. It was no question as to who made Israel to sin.\n\n328\n\nExerciseCareInFormingFriendships,May 30 329\n\nAlthough Solomon afterward repented, his repentance could\n\nnot abolish the idolatrous practices that he had brought into the\n\nnation.

The\n\nevil communications with heathen nations corrupted good manners.\n\nWhen the Lord’s people turn from the God of all wisdom, and look\n\nto people who love not God, in order to obtain wisdom and arrive at\n\ndecisions, the Lord will allow them to follow that wisdom that is not\n\nfrom above but from beneath.—Manuscript 44, 1894 (The General\n\nConference Bulletin, February 25, 1895)."

He had by the help of God defeated the\n\nprophets of Baal. But he was disappointed as to the results of the\n\nmanifestation of God. Under the threats of the wicked queen he lost\n\nhis courage and his faith. He lost sight of Him in whose keeping\n\nhe was, and without being sent he fled for his life. He was terribly\n\ndepressed, for he had hoped for much from the miracle wrought\n\nbefore the people.\n\nHad Elijah, knowing he had done the divine will, maintained\n\nhis confidence in God, had he made God his refuge and strength,\n\nstanding steadfast and immovable for the truth, the impression made\n\nupon the king and the people would have wrought a reformation.\n\nElijah had been braced for trial under the inspiration of God, but\n\nwhen Jezebel’s threatening message was brought to him and shouted\n\nin his ear, awakening from a deep sleep, he lost his hold on God....\n\nThis was the time when he should have had courage in the Lord,\n\nshowing a living, active faith.

Elijah knew not what\n\nhe said when he told God that he had enough of life and asked to\n\ndie.

Elisha was of a family who had kept the ancient\n\ntrue faith of Israel. He did not live in the thickly populated cities.\n\nHis father was a tiller of the soil, a farmer. Even during the captivity\n\nthere were souls who had not degenerated and gone into apostasy,\n\nand this family was included in the seven thousand who had not\n\nbowed the knee to Baal.\n\nElijah was about to close his earthly labors. Another was to be\n\nchosen to carry forward the work to be done for that time. In his\n\ncourse of travel, Elijah was directed northward.... Now everything\n\nseems to be springing up as if to redeem the time of famine and\n\ndearth. The plenteous rains had done more for the earth than for the\n\nhearts of humanity; it was better prepared for labor than were the\n\nhearts of apostate Israel.\n\nWherever Elijah looked, the land he saw was owned by one\n\nman—a man who had not bowed the knee to Baal, whose heart had\n\nremained undivided in the service of God. The owner of this land\n\nwas Shaphat. Busy activity was seen among the husbandry. While\n\nthe flocks were enjoying the green pastures, the busy hands of his\n\nservants were sowing the seed for a harvest.\n\nThe attention of Elijah was attracted to Elisha, the son of\n\nShaphat.... Far from city and court dissipation, Elisha had received\n\nhis education. He had been trained in habits of simplicity, of obedi-\n\nence to his parents and to God.... But though of a meek and quiet\n\nspirit, Elisha had no changeable character. Integrity and fidelity and\n\nthe love and fear of God were his. He had the characteristics of\n\na ruler, but with it all was the meekness of one who would serve.\n\nHis mind had been exercised to be faithful in the little things, to be\n\n348\n\nLearningToLeadThroughServing,June 8 349\n\nfaithful in whatever he should do, so that if God should call him to\n\nact more directly for Him, he would be prepared to hear His voice....\n\nHis surroundings at home were those of wealth, but he realized\n\nthat in order to obtain an all-around education, he must be a constant\n\nworker in any line of work that needed to be done. He would not\n\nconsent to be in any respect less informed than his father’s servants.\n\nHe would learn how to serve first, that he might know how to lead\n\nand instruct and command. While doing all that he possibly could\n\ndo with his God-entrusted capabilities in cooperating with his father\n\nin the home firm, he was doing God service.—Letter 12, 1897."

The Spirit of God impressed the heart of Elisha\n\nin regard to the meaning of this action. This was his signal that God\n\nhad called him to be the successor of Elijah. It was similar to the\n\ncommission of Christ to the young ruler to leave all—houses, lands,\n\nfriends, riches, comforts, and ease, “and come and follow me.”\n\nElijah passed on as if that were the end of the matter.

They made a feast in his home in commemoration of the\n\nhonor conferred upon one of the family. And what was the first\n\nwork of Elisha? It was to take up the little things, and do them with\n\nheartiness. He is spoken of as pouring water on the hands of Elijah\n\nhis master.

Humble, willing service is before everyone\n\nwho claims to be a child of God.\n\nAfter Elisha had been some time in the service of Elijah, he was\n\ncalled to take his place in the first rank. No one in that time was to\n\nbe greater than he. He had worked under Elijah as a learner, and the\n\ntime came when the head manager was removed, and the one under\n\nhim came to the front; andas in Elijahthere was a preparedness to be\n\ntranslated, so Elisha was prepared to take his place as the successor\n\nof the prophet....\n\n“Andthe sons ofthe prophets thatwere atJericho came to Elisha,\n\nand said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy\n\nmaster from thy head today? And he answered, Yea, I know it....\n\nAnd Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the Lord hath\n\nsent me to Jordan.

He had now\n\nset his hand to the plow in another line of work, and he would not\n\nfail nor be discouraged.

Yet he kept at the humble\n\nwork until the last journey. There it was to be revealed to him that\n\nElijah was to be translated. Called as Elisha was from the twelve\n\nyoke of oxen and the plow, he followed Elijah without complaint,\n\nleaving a wealthy home where he was beloved, to attend the prophet\n\nin his uncertain life. He willingly fulfilled the very humblest duties.\n\nHis connection with Elijah revealed that he had traits of character\n\nthat would endure test and trial, that he was a valuable young man\n\nwith precious traits of character. Trials and temptations he had in\n\nabundance, but he relied upon God in trying circumstances. His\n\nsurroundings of wealth and comfort were a temptation. In his home\n\nhe was fully capable of ruling, but in the service of Elijah he must\n\nobtain an experience, he must learn how to serve under a ruler, that\n\nhe might learn to serve God.\n\nMany errors are entertained by people in their vocations. They\n\noverestimate their capabilities, and in test and trial reveal that they\n\nneed a different kind of experience than they have had in order to be\n\na laborer together with Christ. Persons who do not see their need of\n\nserving God in little things, doing humble work, give unmistakable\n\nevidence that they are not fitted to serve in larger things. In over-\n\nlooking the humble service as nonessential, they bear testimony that\n\nthey cannot be trusted with larger responsibilities.\n\nThe idea that prevails in some minds, and that is difficult to\n\nchange, an idea they have permitted to be unconsciously woven into\n\ntheir experience, is that a certain position of gentility and dignity\n\nmust be maintained or else their influence will be marred in their\n\nwork of preaching. But when these learn to minister, they will know\n\n354\n\nEverydayDutiesOfLifeAreImportant,June 11 355\n\nthat humble, active service means to interest themselves in the duties\n\nof everyday life, and to obtain the education essential to do the\n\nordinary duties of life in any small vocation—it may be in tilling the\n\nsoil, in following the plow, in sowing or in reaping....\n\nThere is to be no neglect or low estimate of the lowly, everyday\n\nduties of life. True conversion to God will act as leaven in every\n\nphase of duty in the relationships of life. Then, if the Lord sees us\n\nfaithful in that which is least, diligent and persevering in the use\n\nof our physical powers, doing with our hands that which someone\n\nmust do, He will say, “Come up higher. You may be entrusted with\n\ngreater responsibilities.”—Letter 64, 1897."

Jonah 1:2.\n\nWhen the people of Nineveh humbled themselves before God,\n\nand cried to Him for mercy, He heard their cry. “God saw their\n\nworks, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the\n\nevil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.”\n\nButJonahrevealedthathedidnotvaluethesoulsinthatwretched\n\ncity. He valued his reputation, lest they should say he was a false\n\nprophet.... Now when he sees the Lord exercise His compassionate\n\nattributes and spare the city that had corrupted its ways before Him,\n\nJonah does not co-operate with God in His merciful design. He has\n\nnot the people’s interests in view. It does not grieve him that so\n\nlarge a number must perish who have not been educated to do right.\n\nListen to his complaint:\n\n“Therefore now, O Lord, take, I beseech thee, my life from me;\n\nfor it is better for me to die than to live. Then said the Lord, Doest\n\nthou well to be angry? So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the\n\neast side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in\n\nthe shadow, till he might see what would become of the city. And\n\nthe Lord prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that\n\nit might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So\n\nJonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.”\n\nThen the Lord gave Jonah an object lesson. He “prepared a\n\nworm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd\n\nthat it withered. And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that\n\nGod prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head\n\nof Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is\n\nbetter for me to die than to live.”... “Then said the Lord, Thou hast\n\nhad pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither\n\nmadest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:\n\n360\n\nValueOfSoulsVersusOne’sReputation,June 14 361\n\nAnd should I not spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more\n\nthan sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their\n\nright hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?”\n\nIn the history of Nineveh there is a lesson that you should study\n\ncarefully.... You must know your duty to your fellow beings who\n\nare ignorant and defiled, and who need your help.—Manuscript 164,\n\n1897."

    "content": "But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile\n\nhimself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine\n\nwhich he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the\n\neunuchs that he might not defile himself. Daniel 1:8.\n\nDaniel was but a youth when carried away captive into Babylon.\n\nHe was about fifteen or sixteen years old, for he is called a child,\n\nwhich means that he was in his youth. Why did Daniel refuse to eat\n\nat the king’s luxurious table? Why did he refuse the use of wine as\n\nhis beverage, when it was at the king’s command that it was placed\n\nbefore him? He knew that, by use, wine would become to him a\n\npleasant thing, and would be preferred before water.\n\nDaniel could have argued that at the royal table and at the king’s\n\ncommand, there was no other course for him to pursue. But he and\n\nhis fellows had a council together.... The wine of itself, they decided,\n\nwas a snare. They were acquainted with the history of Nadab and\n\nAbihu that had come to them in parchments. In these men the use\n\nof wine had encouraged their love for it. They drank wine before\n\ntheir sacred services in the sanctuary. Their senses were confused.\n\nThey could not distinguish the difference between the sacred and\n\nthe common fire. In their brain-benumbed state they did that which\n\nthe Lord had charged all who served in holy office not to do....\n\nThe instruction given to the people was carefully treasured up,\n\nand often composed into song and taught to their children, that\n\nthrough song they might become familiar with the truths....\n\nA second consideration of these youthful captives was that the\n\nking always asked a blessing before his meals, and addressed his\n\nidols as deity.... This act, according to their religious instruction,\n\nconsecrated the whole to the heathen god. To sit at the table where\n\nsuch idolatry was practiced, Daniel and his three brethren deemed,\n\nwould be a dishonor to the God of heaven....\n\n362\n\nStandForPrinciple,June 15 363\n\nThere was much involved in this decision. They were regarded\n\nas slaves, but were particularly favored because of their apparent\n\nintelligence and comeliness of person. But they decided that any\n\npretense, even to sit at the table of the king and eat of the food or\n\naccept of the wine, even if they did not drink it, would be a denial of\n\ntheir religious faith.... They did not choose to be singular but they\n\nmust be, else they would corrupt their ways in the courts of Babylon\n\nand be exposed to every kind of temptation in eating and drinking.\n\nThe corrupting influences would remove their safeguard, and they\n\nwould dishonor God and ruin their own characters.—Manuscript\n\n122, 1897.\n\nGod’s Word The Foundation For Character"

Daniel 1:12, 13.\n\nDaniel placed himself in right relation to God and to his outward\n\ncircumstances and opportunities. He was taken as a captive to\n\nBabylon, and with others was placed under training, to be prepared\n\nfor a place in the king’s court. His food and drink were appointed\n\nhim, but we read that he determined that he would not defile himself\n\nwith the king’s meat nor with the wine which he drank.\n\nIn taking this step, Daniel did not act rashly....

Daniel 2:19.\n\nDaniel sought the Lord when the decree went forth to slay all\n\nthe wise men of the kingdom of Babylon because they could not\n\nrelate or interpret a dream that had gone from the king’s mind. He\n\ndemanded not only the interpretation of the dream, but the relation\n\nof the dream itself....\n\nThe magicians were full of fear and trembling.

When his request was granted, Daniel laid\n\nthe whole matter before his companions who were united with him\n\nin worshiping the true God.

With contrition of heart they submitted their case to the\n\ngreat Judge of the earth. It was all that they could do....\n\nDaniel prayed, “I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of\n\nmy fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made\n\nknown unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now\n\nmade known unto us the king’s matter.”...\n\nDanielwasimbuedwiththeSpiritofJesusChrist, andhepleaded\n\nthatthe wise men ofBabylon shouldnotbe destroyed.

Daniel 3:17, 18.\n\nNebuchadnezzar’s wonderful dream caused a marked change in\n\nhis ideas and opinions, and for a little time he was influenced by\n\nthe fear of God; but his heart was not yet cleansed from its pride,\n\nits worldly ambition, its desire for self-exaltation. After the first\n\nimpression wore away, he thought only of his own greatness, and\n\nstudied how the dream might be turned to his own honor.\n\nThe words “Thou art this head of gold” made the deepest impres-\n\nsion upon Nebuchadnezzar’s mind. He determinedto make an image\n\nthat should excel the original. This image was not to deteriorate in\n\nvalue from the head to the feet, like the one he had been shown, but\n\nwas to be composed throughout of the most precious metal. Thus\n\nthe whole image would represent the greatness of Babylon, and he\n\ndetermined that by the splendor of this image the prophecy concern-\n\ning the kingdoms that were to follow should be effaced from his\n\nmind and from the minds of others who had heard the dream and its\n\ninterpretation.

He said, “My lord, the\n\ndream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to\n\nthine enemies.

    "content": "Let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and\n\nto the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and\n\nprosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy\n\nin the sight of this man. Nehemiah 1:11.\n\nNehemiah, the Hebrew exile, occupied a position of influence\n\nand honor in the Persian court. As cupbearer of the king, he was\n\nadmitted to the royal presence, and by virtue of this intimacy and\n\nhis own high abilities and tried fidelity, he became the monarch’s\n\ncounselor. He was a man of high principle, unbending integrity, and\n\ngreat sagacity.\n\nIn that heathen land, surrounded by royal pomp and splendor,\n\nNehemiah did not forget the God of his fathers or the people who\n\nhad been entrusted with the holy oracles. The dignity of his position\n\ndid not rob him of his piety or his love for his brethren.... He was not\n\nashamed to own his relationship to them and to the truth. He felt that\n\nhe must honor the truth in all places. He did not make apology for\n\nholding a faith distinct from the faith of those in the Persian court....\n\nDays of peculiar trial and affliction had come to the chosen city.\n\nMessengers from Judah described to Nehemiah its condition. The\n\nsecond temple had been reared, and portions of the city rebuilt, but\n\nits prosperity was impeded, the temple service disturbed, and the\n\npeople kept in constant alarm by the fact that its walls were still\n\nin ruins and its gates burned with fire. The capital of Judah was\n\nfast becoming a desolate place, and the few inhabitants remaining\n\nwere deeply embittered by the taunts of their idolatrous assailants,\n\n“Where is your God?”\n\nThe soul of the Hebrew patriot was overwhelmed by these evil\n\ntidings. So great was his sorrow that he could not eat or drink; he\n\n“wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted.” But when the first\n\noutburst of his grief was over, he turned in his affliction to the sure\n\n380\n\nPositionDoesNotPrecludeTheNeedForPrayer,June 24 381\n\nHelper. The record says that he “prayed before the God of heaven.”\n\nHe unburdened his heart to God. He knew that the affliction that had\n\ncome upon Israel was the result of her transgression, and with deep\n\nhumiliation he came before God to ask for pardon and a renewal of\n\nthe divine favor. Faithfully he makes confession of his sins and the\n\nsins of his people.\n\nTaking hold by faith of the divine promise, Nehemiah lays down\n\nat the footstool of heavenly mercy his petition that God would main-\n\ntain the cause of his penitent people, restore their strength, and build\n\nup their waste places.—Manuscript 58, 1903."

Nehemiah 2:5.\n\nAt last the sorrow that burdened Nehemiah’s heart could no\n\nlonger be concealed. Sleepless nights devoted to earnest prayer,\n\ncare-filled days, dark with the shadow of hope deferred, leave their\n\ntrace upon his countenance. The keen eye of the monarch, ac-\n\ncustomed jealously to guard his own safety, is accustomed to read\n\ncountenances and to penetrate disguises. Seeing that some secret\n\ntrouble is preying upon his servant, he suddenly inquires, “Why is\n\nthy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else\n\nbut sorrow of heart.”\n\nThe question fills the listener with apprehension. Will not the\n\nking be angry to hear that while outwardly engaged in his service,\n\nthe courtier’s thoughts have been far away with his afflicted people?\n\nWill not the offender’s life be forfeited? And his cherished plan\n\nfor restoring Jerusalem—is it not about to be overthrown? “Then,”\n\nhe says, “I was very sore afraid.” With trembling lips and tearful\n\neyes he reveals the cause of his sorrow—the city, which is the place\n\nof his father’s sepulchre, lying waste, and its gates consumed with\n\nfire. The touching recital awakens the sympathy of the monarch\n\nwithout arousing his idolatrous prejudices; another question gives\n\nthe opportunity for which Nehemiah has long sought: “For what\n\ndost thou make request?”\n\nBut the man of God does not reply until he has first asked the\n\nsupport of One higher than Artaxerxes. “I prayed,” he says, “to the\n\nGod of heaven.” The silent petition then sent to God was the same\n\nthat he had offered for many weeks—that God would prosper his\n\nrequest. And now, taking courage at the thought that he has a Friend,\n\nomniscient and all-powerful, to work in his behalf, the man of God\n\n382\n\nFaithAndWorksShouldBeCombined,June 25 383\n\ncalmly makes known to the king his desire to be released for a time\n\nfrom his office at the court and be authorized to build up the waste\n\nplaces of Jerusalem, and to make it once more a strong and defensed\n\ncity. Momentous results to the Jewish city and nation hang upon this\n\nrequest. “And,” says Nehemiah, “the king granted me, according to\n\nthe good hand of my God upon me.”\n\nWhile Nehemiah implored the help of God, he did not fold his\n\nown hands, feeling that he had no more care or responsibility in the\n\nmatter. With admirable prudence and forethought, he proceeded to\n\nmake all the arrangements necessary to ensure the success of the\n\nenterprise.—Manuscript 58, 1903."

Nehemiah 2:7, 8.\n\nAs his [Nehemiah’s] request to the king had been so favorably\n\nreceived, he was encouraged to ask for such assistance as was nec-\n\nessary to carry out his plans.

Ezra 7:10.\n\nEzra was of the sons of Aaron, a priest whom God chose to be\n\nan instrument of good unto Israel, that He might put honor upon the\n\npriesthood, the glory of which had been greatly eclipsed during the\n\ncaptivity. Ezra was a man of great piety and holy zeal. He was also\n\na man of learning and a ready scribe in the law of Moses. These\n\nqualifications made him an eminent man.\n\nEzra was impressed by the Spirit of God to search the historical\n\nand poetical books of the Bible, and by this means he became famil-\n\niar with the sense and understanding of the law. During the captivity\n\nthe knowledge of God’s will had to some extent been lost. Ezra\n\ngathered all the copies of the law that he could find. He published\n\ncopies of these among God’s people and became a teacher of the law\n\nand the prophecies in the schools of the prophets. The pure Word,\n\nthus diligently taught by Ezra, gave knowledge that was invaluable\n\nat that time....\n\nSome of the prophecies were about to be fulfilled; he would\n\nsearch diligently for the light that had been obscured. He sought this\n\nknowledge that he might educate the people how to bring into their\n\npractical life the principles of the Word of God....\n\nThat which Ezra knew he desired to teach others, and thus he\n\nbecame a mouthpiece forGod, educating those about him in the holy\n\nprinciples thatgovern in heaven....

God knows every\n\nheart, every motive, every thought in the heart; but He permits Satan\n\nto try and tempt and test His believing ones in order that their trust\n\nand confidence in God may be revealed....\n\nThe Lord hates sin; but He loves and forgives the repentant,\n\nbelieving sinner, and takes everyone under His guardianship and\n\ncontrol.

It was the Spirit that led\n\nHim thence, and He went, not in His own behalf, but in our behalf,\n\nto overcome for us. There was no compulsion about it. He was led\n\nby the Spirit, His humanity to be proved, as one who had undertaken\n\nto stand at the head of the fallen race.\n\nChrist had been, and was then, in perfect harmony with the\n\nFather. He was to be tried and tested as a representative of the\n\nrace. He was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to meet the foe in\n\npersonal encounter, to overthrow him who claimed to be the head of\n\nthe kingdoms of the world.\n\nWhile in the wilderness Christ fasted, but He was insensible to\n\nhunger.

Would He leave Him in the desert with wild\n\nbeasts, without food, without companions, without comfort? He\n\ninsinuates that God never meant His Son to be in such a state as\n\nthis....\n\nThe words from heaven, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am\n\nwell pleased,” were still sounding in the ears of Satan. But he was\n\ndetermined to make Christ disbelieve this testimony. The word of\n\nGod was Christ’s assurance of His divine mission.... It was Satan’s\n\npurpose to make Him doubt this word. If Christ’s confidence in God\n\ncould be shaken, Satan knew that victory in the whole conflict would\n\nbe his. He could overcome Jesus. He hoped that under the force\n\nof despondency and extreme hunger, Christ would lose faith in His\n\nFather and work a miracle in His own behalf. Had He done this, the\n\nplan of salvation would have been broken.\n\nAnd Christ, the Son of God, answering said, “It is written, Man\n\nshall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth\n\nout of the mouth of God.” Christ had been warned not to enter into\n\nargument with Satan. And though He recognized him from the\n\nbeginning, He was not provoked to enter into controversy with him.\n\nStrengthened with the memory of the voice from heaven, He rested\n\nin His Father’s love.

Meek and lowly, and seemingly helpless, Christ was\n\nstronger than the strong man armed. Oh, how Satan strove to make\n\nHim sin against God! But all his efforts failed to make Christ swerve\n\nfrom His allegiance.\n\nOur Saviour could receive the heavenly revelation without be-\n\ncoming self-exalted.... The enemy is subtle and very daring, but he\n\nis not invincible.

Here Christ was brought face-to-face with the subtle\n\npower of Satan, the fallen angel. The enemy pursued the same\n\ncourse with the Saviour that he did with Adam and Eve in Eden.

If you are the Son of\n\nGod, he said, give me evidence that You are....\n\nWell did Satan know who Christ was, for when the Saviour went\n\nto Gadara, the evil spirits in the two madmen there cried out, “What\n\nhave we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? Art thou come\n\nhither to torment us before the time?” As Christ passed through the\n\ntest of the second Adam, His beauty of character shone out through\n\nHis disguise.

He knew that if he could\n\ninduce Christ to yield one jot in His allegiance to His Father, he\n\nwould have the world entirely in his power, and would be able to\n\nrule as only he in his changed spiritual nature could rule. But the\n\nOne Satan was trying to overcome was the Lord of heaven, and all\n\nthe efforts of the tempter were without avail.

Itwas necessaryforHim to know the power\n\nof all our temptations, to pass through all the trials and afflictions\n\nthat we are called to pass through, in order to be indeed a Saviour....\n\nSatan, the powerful foe who had been turned out of heaven, had\n\nlong claimed to have dominion on the earth, and Christ came to\n\nconquer this foe, in order that we might, through divine grace, also\n\nobtain the victory over the enemy of our souls. Standing at the head\n\nof humanity, Christ by His perfect obedience demonstrated to the\n\nuniverse that human beings could keep the commandments of God.\n\nUnder all circumstances—whether in prosperity or in adversity,\n\nwhether received or rejected, whether at the marriage feast or suffer-\n\ning the pangs of hunger—Christ remained faithful to every precept\n\nof God’s law, and wrought out for our example a perfect life. He has\n\nendured every hardship that comes to the poor and afflicted. Without\n\nsin He has suffered weariness and hunger. He understands every\n\ninconvenience to which we may be put. From childhood to manhood\n\nHe stood the test of obedience.\n\nWhen Jesus was led into the wilderness to be tempted, He was\n\nled by the Spirit of God. He did not invite temptation. He went into\n\nthe wilderness to be alone, to contemplate His mission and work. By\n\nfasting and prayer He was to brace Himself for the bloodstained path\n\nHe must travel. But Satan knew that the Saviour had gone into the\n\nwilderness, and he thought this was the best time to approach Him.\n\nWeak and emaciated from hunger, worn and haggard with mental\n\nagony, Christ’s “visage was so marred more than any man, and his\n\n402\n\nChristProvedThatWeCanKeepTheCommandments,July 4 403\n\nform more than the sons of men.” Now was Satan’s opportunity.\n\nNow he supposed that he could overcome Christ.\n\nThe first temptation was on the point of appetite. There came\n\nto the Saviour, as if in answer to His prayers, one in the guise of an\n\nangel from heaven. He claimed to have a commission from God to\n\ndeclare that Christ’s fast was at an end. The Saviour was faint from\n\nhunger; He was craving for food when Satan came suddenly upon\n\nHim. Pointing to the stones that strewed the desert, and that had the\n\nappearance of loaves of bread, the tempter said, “If thou be the Son\n\nof God, command that these stones be made bread.”—Manuscript\n\n155, 1902 (Sermons and Talks, 2:217, 218)."

Should Jesus do that which Satan suggests, it would\n\nbe an acceptance of the doubt. If Christ’s confidence in God could\n\nbe shaken, Satan knew that the victory in the whole controversy\n\nwould be his. He hoped that under the force of despondency and\n\nextreme hunger, Christ would lose faith in His Father and work a\n\nmiracle in His own behalf.\n\nNot without a struggle could Jesus listen in silence to the archde-\n\nceiver. But the Son of God was not to prove His divinity to Satan.\n\nHe met the tempter with the words of Scripture. “It is written,” He\n\nsaid, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that pro-\n\nceedeth out of the mouth of God.” In every temptation the weapon\n\nof His warfare was the Word of God.\n\nWhen Christ said to the tempter, “Man shall not live by bread\n\nalone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,”\n\nHe repeated the words that more than fourteen hundred years before,\n\nHe had spoken to Israel. And the same words are written for our\n\nadmonition. We are to commune with the One who gives us life, the\n\nOne who keeps the heart in motion and the pulse beating. God is\n\ngiving the breath of life to every member of His great family here\n\nbelow. He deserves your sincere reverence, your earnest devotion.\n\nWhen you consider what He has done for you, how can you help\n\nloving Him? He has given His Son as a propitiation for sin, in order\n\nthat you might stand on vantage ground with God.\n\nIf the world should recognize the claims of God upon them, we\n\nwould not see and hear of the awful sins that are now so common;\n\nwe would not read of the murders, the wickedness, and the tyranny\n\ndaily chronicled in the newspapers.

But\n\nwhen he quoted the promise “He shall give his angels charge over\n\nthee,” he omitted the words “to keep thee in all thy ways,” that is, in\n\nall the ways of God’s choosing. Jesus refused to go outside the path\n\nof obedience. He would not force Providence to come to His rescue,\n\nand thus fail of giving us an example of trust and submission. Never\n\ndid He work a miracle in His own behalf. His wonderful works\n\nwere all for the good of others. Jesus declared to Satan, “It is written\n\nagain, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.” God will preserve all\n\nwho walk in the path of obedience, but to depart from it is to venture\n\non Satan’s ground. There we are sure to fall....\n\nJesus was victor in the second temptation, and now Satan man-\n\nifests himself in his true character, claiming to be the god of this\n\nworld. Placing Jesus upon a high mountain, Satan caused the king-\n\ndoms of the world, in all their glory, to pass in panoramic view\n\nbefore Him. The eyes of Jesus, so lately greeted by gloom and\n\ndesolation, now gazed upon a scene of unsurpassed loveliness and\n\nprosperity. Then the tempter’s voice was heard, “All this power will\n\nI give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and\n\nto whomsoever I will give it.

Psalm 91:11, 12.\n\nIt is expressly stated that Satan works in the children of disobedi-\n\nence, not merely having access to their minds, but working through\n\ntheir influence, conscious and unconscious, to draw others into the\n\nsame disobedience.

He depended upon “It\n\nis written.” In this conflict the humanity of Christ was taxed as none\n\nof us will ever know.\n\nThe Prince of life and the prince of darkness met in terrible\n\nconflict, but Satan was unable to gain the least advantage in word\n\nor in action. These were real temptations, no pretense. Christ\n\n“suffered being tempted.” Angels of heaven were on the scene on\n\nthat occasion, and kept the standard uplifted, that Satan could not\n\nexceed his bounds and overpower the human nature of Christ. In the\n\nlast temptation Satan presented to Christ the prospect of gaining the\n\nwhole world with all its glory if He would only worship him who\n\nclaimed to be sent of God. Christ must then issue His command. He\n\nmust then exercise authority above all satanic agencies.\n\nDivinity flashed through humanity, and Satan was peremptorily\n\nrepulsed. “Get thee hence, Satan,” Christ said.... It was enough.\n\n410\n\nAngelsInvolvedInTimesOfTemptation,July 8 411\n\nSatan could go no further. Angels ministered to the Saviour. Angels\n\nbrought Him food. The severity of this conflict no human mind can\n\ncompass. The welfare of the whole human family and of Christ\n\nHimself was at stake. One admission from Christ, one word of\n\nconcession, and the world would be claimed by Satan as his; and he,\n\nthe prince of the power of darkness would, he supposed, commence\n\nhis rule.

Luke 4:3-9.\n\nIn the wilderness of temptation the riches of the world was the\n\nbribe presented to our Lord. Satan did not come to Him with his\n\ntemptations until the human nature was weakened and was crying\n\nout its necessity....\n\nChrist’s humanity would have shrunk from that which awaited\n\nHim in the desert. But He came to the world so that by coming into\n\nclose contact with him [Satan], He might wrest from the hands of\n\nthe usurper the Lord’s human heritage....\n\nSatan knew that the personal controversy between the Prince of\n\nlife and the prince of darkness had commenced, and he sought to\n\novercome Christ in His physical weakness. The proof that Satan\n\nrequired was for Christ to accept the doubt and act upon it, thus\n\nshowing that He entertained the doubt by giving the evidence that\n\nSatan desired. Had Christ complied with this suggestion of the\n\nenemy, his satanic majesty would still have said, Show me a sign,\n\nthat I may believe you to be the Son of God. But not one of the signs\n\nspecified was Christ to give. By working a miracle in His own behalf\n\nHe would show that He questioned God. That sign that is greater\n\nthan all miracles, a firm reliance upon a “Thus saith the Lord,” was\n\na sign that could not be controverted....\n\nHow artfully had Satan approached Eve in Eden! “Yea, hath God\n\nsaid, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?” Thus far every\n\nword that Satan spoke was truth, but his manner of saying them was\n\na disguised contempt for the words of God. There was in his words\n\nof truth a covert negative, a denial, a doubt of the divine truthfulness.\n\nHe sought to instill into her mind the thought that God would not\n\n422\n\nWeCanAlwaysRelyUpon“ThusSaithTheLord”,July 14 423\n\ndo as He had said, that the withholding of such beautiful fruit was a\n\ncontradiction of His love and compassion for them.\n\nAnd now he seeks to inspire Christ with his own sentiments. “If\n\nthou be the Son of God.” Thus he sought to imbue Christ with his\n\ndoubts.... Would God treat His own Son thus?...\n\nTemptations will arise [among some] to cause distrust of God\n\nand to question His love.... They become traitors, rebels against\n\nGod, and accept the temptations of him whom they choose as their\n\nleader. They become a medium for Satan, a channel through which\n\nhe communicates to otherminds the doubts andinfidelitywithwhich\n\nhe has imbued them.—Letter 3, 1897.\n\nFervent, Importunate Prayer Will Bring Divine"

Luke 13:24.\n\nChrist resisted the manifold temptations of Satan on our behalf,\n\nand through His name made it possible for us to overcome Satan on\n\nour own behalf. When we are burdened, when we are pressed with\n\ntemptation, when the feelings and desires of the natural heart are\n\ncontending for the victory, we should offer up fervent, importunate\n\nprayer to our heavenly Father in the name of Christ; and this will\n\nbring Jesus to our help, so that, through His all-powerful and effi-\n\ncacious name, we may gain the victory and banish Satan from our\n\nside.

Satan knew that everything depended\n\nupon his success or failure in his attempt to overcome Christ with\n\nhis manifold temptations. Satan knew that the plan of salvation\n\nwould be carried out to its fulfillment, that his power would be taken\n\naway, that his destruction would be certain, if Christ bore the test\n\nthat Adam failed to endure.—Manuscript 65, 1894 (The Review and\n\nHerald, February 5, 1895)."

We know\n\nthat in our own strength it is not possible for us to succeed; but as\n\nChrist humbled Himself and took upon Himself our nature, He is\n\nacquainted with our necessities, and has Himself borne the heaviest\n\ntemptations that human beings will have to bear, has conquered the\n\nenemy in resisting his suggestions, in order that we may learn how\n\nto be conquerors....\n\nChrist is our pattern, the perfect and holy example that has been\n\ngiven us to follow.

A communication is\n\nopened with heaven through Jesus Christ [so] that the human race,\n\nwhich was fallen, is brought back again into favor with God.

I see One who died in\n\nmy behalf, and He shall not die for me in vain. I will place myself in\n\nright relation to God, and I will have a right hold from above.

    "content": "All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for\n\nreproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, so\n\nthat everyone who belongs to God may be proficient, equipped\n\nfor every good work. 2 Timothy 3:16, 17, NRSV.\n\nThe great leading temptations wherewith we would be beset,\n\nChrist met and overcame in the wilderness. His coming off victor\n\nover appetite, presumption, and the world shows how we may over-\n\ncome. Satan has overcome his millions in tempting the appetite and\n\nleading people to give up to presumptuous sins. There are many\n\nwho profess to be followers of Christ, claiming by their faith to be\n\nenlisted in the warfare against all evil in their nature, yet who, with\n\nhardly a thought, plunge into scenes of temptation that would re-\n\nquire a miracle to bring them forth unsullied. Meditation and prayer\n\nwould have preserved them and led them to shun the dangerous\n\npositions in which they have placed themselves, and that give Satan\n\nthe advantage over them.\n\nThe promises of God are not for us to claim rashly, to protect\n\nus while we rush on recklessly into danger, violating the laws of\n\nnature, or disregarding prudence and the judgment God has given\n\nus to use. This would not be genuine faith but presumption. The\n\nthrones and kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, were\n\npresented to Christ. Never will we have temptations as strong as\n\nthose that assailed Him.\n\nBut Satan comes to us with worldly honor, wealth, and the\n\npleasures of life. These temptations are varied to meet people of\n\nevery rank and degree, tempting them away from God to serve\n\nthemselves more than their Creator. “All these things will I give\n\nthee,” said Satan to Christ. “All these things will I give thee,” says\n\nSatan to us. “All this money, this land, all this power, this honor,\n\nand these riches, will I give thee,” and we are charmed, deceived,\n\n442\n\nJesusOurExampleOnHowToOvercomeSatan,July 24 443\n\nand treacherously allured on to our ruin. If we give ourselves up to\n\nworldliness of heart and of life, Satan is satisfied.\n\nThe Saviour overcame the wily foe, showing us how we may\n\novercome. He has left us His example, to repel Satan with Scripture.\n\nHe might have had recourse to His own divine power and used His\n\nown words, but His example would not then have been as useful to\n\nus. Christ used only Scripture. How important that the Word of God\n\nbe thoroughly studied and followed, that in case of emergency we\n\nmay be “throughly furnished unto all good works” and especially\n\nfortified to meet the wily foe.—Letter 1 a, 1872."

Isaiah 27:5.\n\nImagine, if you can, yourself in Christ’s stead in the wilderness.\n\nThere is no human voice you hear, but you are surrounded with\n\ndemons under deceptive pretensions as angels from heaven, present-\n\ning in the most seducing attractions Satan’s wily insinuations against\n\nGod, as he did to our first parents. His sophistry is most deceiving\n\nand artful in undermining your confidence in God and destroying\n\nyour faith and your trust. He keeps your mind on a constant strain\n\nso that he can get one clue that he can use to his own advantage to\n\nallure you into a controversy, as if reading your thoughts to which\n\nyou will not give utterance, just as he did Eve.\n\nHe could not obtain from Christ one word to lead him on. The\n\nword, “It is written,” was spoken from point to point as he tested\n\nHim. But only the quotation of His own words that He had inspired\n\nthe holy men of old to write would come from Christ’s lips... In our\n\nLord’s great scene of conflict in the wilderness, apparently under\n\nthe power of Satan and his angels, was He capable, in His human\n\nnature, of yielding to these temptations? ...\n\nAs God He could not be tempted, but as a man He could be\n\ntempted, and that strongly, and could yield to the temptations. His\n\nhuman nature must pass through the same test and trial Adam and\n\nEve passed through. His human nature was created; it did not even\n\npossess the angelic powers. It was human, identical with our own.\n\nHe was passing over the ground where Adam fell. He was now\n\nwhere, if He endured the test and trial in behalf of the fallen race,\n\nHe would redeem Adam’s disgraceful failure and fall, in our own\n\nhumanity.\n\nA human body and a human mind were His. He was bone of\n\nour bone and flesh of our flesh.... He was subject to disappointment\n\n444\n\nOurSaviourWasTemptedExactlyAsWeAre,July 25 445\n\nand trial in His own home, among His own brethren. He was not\n\nsurrounded, as in the heavenly courts, with pure and lovely charac-\n\nters. He was compassed with difficulties. He came into our world\n\nto maintain a pure, sinless character, and to refute Satan’s lie that it\n\nwas not possible for human beings to keep the law of God....\n\nThrough being partakers of the divine nature we may stand pure\n\nand holy and undefiled. The Godhead was not made human, and the\n\nhuman was not deified by the blending together of the two natures.\n\nChrist did not possess the same sinful, corrupt, fallen disloyalty we\n\npossess, for then He could not be a perfect offering.—Manuscript\n\n94, 1893 (Manuscript Releases 6:110-112)."

Never can we\n\nunderstand the value of the human soul until we realize the great\n\nsacrifice made for the redemption of the soul upon Calvary. Adam’s\n\nsin in Eden plunged the human race into hopeless misery. But in\n\nthe scheme of salvation a way has been provided for all to escape if\n\nthey comply with the requirements.

John 1:10.\n\nAll that the world could endure of their Redeemer was the few\n\nyears He was with them upon the earth, and they wanted to get rid\n\nof Him almost as soon as His mission commenced.... The question\n\nthat every one of us has to settle is: Am I prepared for the coming\n\nof the Son of man? If you have accepted your Saviour by living\n\nfaith, if you have repented of your sins, then you are in a position of\n\nacceptance with God so that if Christ should come you would meet\n\nHim in peace....\n\nLet us notice the steps that the Son of man had to take in order\n\nto carry out the plan of salvation. He stepped down from the royal\n\nthrone,laidasideHisroyalrobes,clothedHisdivinitywithhumanity,\n\nand consented to come to this world. This world—right here—was\n\nto be the field of battle where Christ and Satan, the prince of this\n\nearth, should engage in conflict. And the question to be settled was\n\nHow could God be just and true to His law and yet justify the sinner?\n\nThis could be done only by the sacrifice of the Son of God....\n\nIt was difficult to uproot Satan from the affection of the angels\n\nin heaven. He took the position that the law of God was against the\n\nheavenly intelligences, and the warfare and controversy between\n\nChrist and Satan was started in heaven and is going on in the earth\n\nto the present day.

Deuteronomy 8:3, NRSV.\n\nThe duel between Christ and Satan was fought in the wilderness,\n\nChrist with apparently not a friend to aid Him. Satan was subtle;\n\nfalsehood is his stock in trade. With all the power that he possessed\n\nhe tried to overcome the humanity of Christ....\n\nSatan charmed the first Adam by his sophistry, just as he charms\n\nmen and women today, leading them to believe a lie. Adam did not\n\nreach above his humanity for divine power; he believed the words of\n\nSatan. But the second Adam was not to become the enemy’s bond\n\nslave.\n\nAdam had the advantage over Christ in that, when he was as-\n\nsailed by the tempter, none of the effects of sin were upon him. He\n\nstood in the strength of perfect manhood, possessing the full vigor\n\nof mind and body. He was surrounded with the glories of Eden and\n\nwas in daily communion with heavenly beings. It was not thus with\n\nJesus when He entered the wilderness to cope with Satan....\n\nEvery device that the enemy could suggest was brought against\n\nHim. It was when Christ was in a weakened condition, after His\n\nlong fast of forty days, that the wisest of the fallen angels used\n\nthe most enticing words at his command in an effort to compel\n\nthe mind of Christ to yield to his mind.... “If thou be the Son of\n\nGod,” he said, “show thy power by relieving thyself of this pressing\n\nhunger.”“Command that these stones be made bread.”...\n\nWhen Christ said to Satan, “Man shall not live by bread alone,\n\nbut by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,” He\n\nrepeated the words that, more than fourteen hundred years before,\n\nHe had spoken to Israel. [Deuteronomy 8:3, quoted].\n\n452\n\nBetterToSufferThanToYieldToTemptation,July 29 453\n\nIn the wilderness, when all means of sustenance failed, God sent\n\nHis people manna from heaven; and a sufficient and constant supply\n\nwas given. This provision was to teach them that while they trusted\n\nin God and walked in His ways, He would not forsake them. The\n\nSaviour now practiced the lesson He had taught to Israel. By the\n\nword of God succor had been given to the Hebrew host, and by the\n\nsame word it would be given to Jesus. He awaited God’s time to\n\nbring relief. He was in the wilderness in obedience to God, and He\n\nwould not obtain food by following the suggestions of Satan. In the\n\npresence of the witnessing universe, He testified that it is a lesser\n\ncalamity to suffer whatever may befall than to depart in any manner\n\nfrom the will of God.—Manuscript 113, 1902."

Into this effort he threw all\n\nhis beguiling power. It was the charm of the serpent. He exerted the\n\npower of his fascination upon Christ, striving to make Him yield\n\nHis will to him. In His weakness Christ laid hold of God. Divinity\n\nflashed through humanity. Christ stood revealed as the Commander\n\nof heaven, and His words were the words of one who has all power.\n\n“Get thee behind me, Satan,” He said, “for it is written, Thou shalt\n\nworship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.”\n\nSatan had questioned whether Jesus was the Son of God. In his\n\nsummary dismissal he had proof that he could not gainsay. He had\n\nno power to resist the command. Writhing with humiliation and\n\nrage, he was forced to withdraw from the presence of the world’s\n\nRedeemer. Christ’s victory was as complete as had been the failure\n\nof Adam.\n\nChrist knew of the long years of conflict in the future between\n\nhuman beings and their subtle foe. He is the refuge of all who, beset\n\nby temptation, call upon Him. Temptation and trial will come to\n\nus all, but we need never be worsted by the enemy. Our Saviour\n\nhas conquered in our behalf. Satan is not invincible. Day by day\n\nhe meets those who are on trial, striving by his wiles to gain the\n\nmastery over them. His accusing power is great, and it is in this line\n\nthat he wins more victories than in any other. Christ was tempted,\n\n454\n\nChristKnowsJustHowToHelpUsOvercome,July 30 455\n\nthat He might know how to help every soul that should afterward be\n\ntempted. Temptation is not sin; the sin lies in yielding. To the soul\n\nwho trusts in Jesus, temptation means victory and greater strength.\n\nChrist is ready to pardon all who come to Him confessing their\n\nsins. To the tried, struggling soul is spoken the word “Let him take\n\nhold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall\n\nmake peace with me.” Thank God, we have a high priest who is\n\ntouched with the feelings of our infirmities, for He was in all points\n\ntempted as we are.—Manuscript 113, 1902."

He was to\n\nbe like those who belonged to the human family and to the Jewish\n\nrace. His features were to be like those of other human beings, and\n\nHe was not to have such beauty of person as to make people point\n\nHim out as different from others. He was to come as one of the\n\nhuman family, and to stand as a man before heaven and earth. He\n\nhad come to take our place, to pledge Himself in our behalf, to pay\n\nthe debt that sinners owed.

Luke\n\n2:49.\n\nEvery year His parents went to the city of Jerusalem to attend\n\nthe feast of the Passover, and in His twelfth year Jesus went with\n\nthem to the city. When the feast was over, the parents, forgetting all\n\nabout Jesus, started on their road home with some of their relations,\n\nand did not know that Jesus was not with them. They supposed that\n\nHe was in the company, and went a whole day’s journey before they\n\nfound out that He was not there. Frightened as to what had become\n\nof Him, they turned back to the city....\n\nJesus knew that God had given Him this opportunity to give light\n\nto those who were in darkness, and He sought to do all in His power\n\nto open the truth to the rabbis and teachers. He led these men to\n\nspeak about different verses in the Bible telling about the Messiah\n\nwhom they expected to come. They thought that Christ was to come\n\nto the world in great glory at this time, and make the Jewish nation\n\nthe greatest nation on the earth. But Jesus asked them what the\n\nScriptures meant when they spoke of the humble life, the suffering\n\nand sorrow, the rejection and death, of the Son of God. Though\n\nChrist seemed like a child that was seeking help from those who\n\nknew a great deal more than He did, He was bringing light to their\n\nminds in every word He spoke....\n\nWhile Christ was teaching others, He Himself was receiving\n\nlight and knowledge about His own work and mission in the world,\n\nforitis plainlystatedthatChrist“grewin knowledge.” Whata lesson\n\nthere is in this for all the youth of our day!

This was the burden of His soul, and He was alone in carrying\n\nthis load.... From His youth He was filled with a deep longing to be\n\na lamp in the world, and He purposed that His life should be “the\n\nlight of the world.” This He was, and that light still shines to all who\n\nare in darkness.

He worked miracles to heal the sick, but He never worked a\n\nmiracle in His own behalf. His first noted miracle was performed at\n\na marriage feast in Cana, when He turned water into wine....\n\nBy this miracle Christ wished to teach that unfermented wine\n\nis far preferable to fermented wine. Christ never created fermented\n\nwine. The wine made on this occasion was exactly like the wine that\n\ncomes fresh from the cluster. Christ knew the influence of fermented\n\nwine, and by giving them pure, unfermented wine, He showed them\n\nthe only safe way in which to use grape juice.\n\nChrist did not draw attention to this act to receive public notice.\n\nHe wished to teach an important lesson. He did not make or use\n\nfermented wine.... Christ did turn water into wine, but He used wine\n\nfresh from the grapes, and never any other. He is our example in all\n\nthings, and before His death He left as a last legacy to His church\n\nthe bread, representing His body given for the sins of the world, and\n\nthe wine, representing His spilt blood. But nothing but unleavened\n\nbread and unfermented wine could be used. Nothing of a fermented\n\ncharacter is to be used in the Communion service, for fermented\n\nwine would destroy the figure representing the blood of Christ. We\n\nmay all look upon this question as forever settled.\n\nChrist wrought this miracle to teach still another lesson. He\n\nwould not yield to the enemy when tempted to perform a miracle to\n\nsupply His own necessities by converting a stone into bread. But\n\non the occasion of the marriage feast He desired to express His\n\nsympathy with, and approval of, those at the wedding. Christ did not\n\ncome to this world to forbid marriage or to break down or destroy\n\nthe relationship and influence that exist in the domestic circle. He\n\n480\n\nWaterToWine,August 11 481\n\ncame to restore, elevate, purify, and ennoble every current of pure\n\naffection, that the family on earth might become a symbol of the\n\nfamily in heaven.

In such families the\n\nsong may well be sung, “There are angels hovering round; there are\n\nangels hovering round. Go, carry the tidings home.”—Manuscript\n\n22, 1898."

    "content": "There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith\n\nunto her, Give me to drink. John 4:7.\n\nConsider how circumstances that occur bring truth before the\n\nminds of others. Call to mind the woman of Samaria who came, as\n\nwas her usual custom, to draw water. A stranger sitting on the well\n\nasks her for a drink. A conversation begins. Jesus says to her, “If\n\nthou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give\n\nme to drink; thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have\n\ngiven thee living water.”“Whosoever drinketh of this water shall\n\nthirst again: but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give\n\nhim shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in\n\nhim a well of water springing up into everlasting life.”\n\nRemembering the weary work that she had to repeat day after\n\nday, and thinking what an advantage it would be if she could have\n\nwater without all this trouble, the woman said, “Sir, give me this\n\nwater, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.” She did not\n\nrealize that Jesus was presenting to her the soul’s highest interest,\n\nthe water of life.\n\nThe words spoken by Christ were the living water. But she soon\n\nbecame so interested that she left her water pot and, going into the\n\ncity, bore the words to her countrymen, “Come, see a man, which\n\ntold me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?”\n\nThe woman had come for water, and she heard of the water of\n\nlife. She had been convinced of sin, and believed on Jesus Christ.\n\nThus the holy oil is emptied, by the holy messengers represented by\n\nthe two olive trees, into the golden tubes and from thence into the\n\ngolden bowls. The emptying process goes on, from the receiving of\n\nthe golden oil to the communicating of the same to others. Words\n\nare spoken; the unconscious influences that surround the soul are\n\nfelt, although no words are designedly spoken. A word may be often\n\nspoken that will be as seed sown....\n\n482\n\nLivingWaterComesFromJesus,August 12 483\n\nThe Lord has made ample provision that the heavenly graces\n\nshall be abundantly supplied to all, that the truth as it is in Jesus\n\nshall hold the first place in the heart and shall ever occupy the soul\n\ntemple. Then there will be thorough devotion to God, and all true\n\nbelievers will become fishers of men. They will pray for wisdom,\n\nand will walk in accordance with the prayer: “Ye are the light of the\n\nworld.” “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your\n\ngood works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.”—Letter\n\n48, 1897."

    "content": "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James,\n\nand Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here\n\nwith us? And they were offended at him. Mark 6:3.\n\nChrist’s life of humiliation should be a lesson to all who desire to\n\nexalt themselves above others. Though He had no taint of sin upon\n\nHis character, yet He condescended to connect our fallen human\n\nnature with His divinity....\n\nIn humility Christ began His mighty work of lifting the fallen\n\nrace from the degradation of sin, recovering them by His divine\n\npower, which He had linked with humanity. Passing by the grand\n\ncities and the renowned places of learning and supposed wisdom,\n\nHe made His home in the humble and obscure village of Nazareth.\n\nThe greater part of His life was passed in this place, from which it\n\nwas commonly believed that no good could come. In the path that\n\nthe poor, the neglected, the suffering, and the sorrowing must tread,\n\nHe walked while on earth, taking upon Him all the woes that the\n\nafflicted must bear.... His family was not distinguished by learning,\n\nriches, or position. For many years He worked at His trade as a\n\ncarpenter.\n\nThe Jews had proudly boasted that Christ was to come as a king,\n\nto conquer His enemies and tread down the heathen in His wrath.\n\nBut the humble, submissive life our Saviour led, which should have\n\nenshrined Him in the hearts of the people and given them confidence\n\nin His mission, offended and disappointed the Jews, and we all know\n\nof the treatment He received from them....\n\nChrist did not exalt people by ministering to their pride. He\n\nhumbled Himself, and became obedient to death, even the death\n\nof the cross. Unless human pride is humbled and subdued, unless\n\nthe stubborn heart is made tender by the Spirit of Christ, it is not\n\npossible for Him to impress His divine similitude upon us. He, the\n\n484\n\nNoPositionTooLowlyToBeHonorableInChrist,August 13 485\n\nhumble Nazarene, might have poured contempt upon the world’s\n\npride, for He was commander in the heavenly courts. But He came\n\nto our world in humility, in order to show that it is not riches or\n\nposition or authority or honorable titles that the universe of heaven\n\nrespects and honors, but those who will follow Christ, making any\n\nposition of duty honorable by the virtue of their character through\n\nthe power of His grace.\n\nNo human being is warranted to uplift self in pride. “For thus\n\nsaith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is\n\nHoly; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a\n\ncontrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to\n\nrevive the heart of the contrite ones.”—Letter 81, 1896."

    "content": "Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto\n\nthee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom\n\nof God. John 3:3.\n\nThe change that must come to the natural, inherited, and culti-\n\nvated tendencies of the human heart is that change of which Jesus\n\nspoke when He said to Nicodemus, “Except a man be born again, he\n\ncannot see the kingdom of God.”... He virtually said to Nicodemus,\n\nIt is not controversy that will help your case. Arguments will not\n\nbring light to your soul. You must have a new heart, or you cannot\n\ndiscern the kingdom of heaven. It is not greater evidence that will\n\nbring you into a right position, but new purposes, new springs of ac-\n\ntion. You must be born again. Until this change takes place, until all\n\nthings are made new, the strongest evidence that could be presented\n\nwould be useless....\n\nTo Nicodemus this was a very humiliating statement, and with\n\na feeling of irritation he took up the words of Christ, saying, “How\n\ncan a man be born when he is old?”... But the Saviour did not meet\n\nargument with argument. Raising His hand in solemn, quiet dignity,\n\nHe pressed home the truth with greater assurance, “Verily, verily, I\n\nsay unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he\n\ncannot enter into the kingdom of God.”...\n\nChrist’s words conveyed the lesson that instead of feeling irri-\n\ntatedoverthe plain words oftruthandindulging in irony, Nicodemus\n\nshould have a far more humble opinion of himself because of his\n\nspiritual ignorance. Yet the words of Christ were spoken with such\n\nsolemn dignity, and both look and tone expressed such earnest love\n\nthat Nicodemus was not offended as he realized his humiliating\n\nposition....\n\nThis lesson to Nicodemus I present as highly applicable to those\n\nwho today are in responsible positions as rulers in Israel, and whose\n\n486\n\nChristWillCreateANewHeartInHisFollowers,August 14 487\n\nvoices are often heard in council, giving evidence of the spirit that\n\nNicodemus possessed. The words of Christ are spoken just as verily\n\ntopresidentsofconferences, eldersofchurches, andthoseoccupying\n\nresponsible positions in our churches....\n\nNicodemus was converted as the result of this interview. In that\n\nnight conference with Jesus, the convicted man stood before the\n\nSaviour under the softening, subduing influence of the truth that was\n\nshining into the chambers of his mind and impressing his heart....\n\nJesus told Nicodemus not only that he must have a new heart in\n\norder to see the kingdom of heaven, but how to obtain this new\n\nheart.—Letter 54, 1895."

John 7:45,\n\n46.\n\nChrist came to this world just as the Old Testament Scriptures\n\nforetold that He would come, but notwithstanding this, He was\n\nmisapprehended and misjudged. The Pharisees were filled with\n\na frenzy of hatred against Him, because they could see that His\n\nteaching had a power and an attractiveness of which their words\n\nwere utterly devoid. They decided that the only way to cut off His\n\ninfluence was to pass sentence of death upon Him, and therefore\n\nthey sent officers to take Him. But when these officers came within\n\nhearing of His voice, and listened to His gracious words, they were\n\ncharmed into forgetting their errand....\n\n“Are ye also deceived?” the elders asked.... Nicodemus saith\n\nunto them, “Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and\n\nknow what he doeth?”\n\nThe lesson that Christ had given to Nicodemus had not been in\n\nvain. Conviction had fastened upon his mind, and in his heart he\n\nhad accepted Jesus. Since his interview with the Saviour, he had\n\nearnestly searched the Old Testament Scriptures, and he had seen\n\ntruth placed in the setting of the gospel.\n\nThequestionaskedbyhimwaswiseandwouldhavecommended\n\nitself to those presiding at the council had they not been deceived by\n\nthe enemy. But they were so filled with prejudice that no argument\n\nin favor of Jesus of Nazareth, however convincing, had any weight\n\nwith them. The answer that Nicodemus received was “Art thou also\n\nof Galilee? Search, and look; for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.”\n\nThe priests and rulers had been deceived, as Satan meant them to\n\nbe, into believing that Christ came out of Galilee. Some who knew\n\n488\n\n“NeverManSpakeLikeThisMan”,August 15 489\n\nthat He had been born in Bethlehem kept silent, that the falsehood\n\nmight not be robbed of its power.\n\nThe facts were plain. There was no dimness of the light. But the\n\nwork of Christ was interpreted by different ones in accordance with\n\nthe state of their minds....\n\nThe Prince of Peace came to proclaim truth that was to bring har-\n\nmony out of confusion. But He who came to bring peace and good-\n\nwill started a controversy that ended in His crucifixion.—Manuscript\n\n31, 1889."

Through their own perversity, they were\n\ngoing on to destruction, but Christ came to dispute the authority of\n\nSatan....\n\nThe life of Christ was made one long scene of conflict.

Matthew 14:27.\n\nI was today to write upon Christ walking on the sea and stilling\n\nthe tempest.... How vividly before my mind was the boat, with the\n\ndisciples, buffeted by the waves. The night was dark and tempes-\n\ntuous. Their Master was absent. The sea was strong, the winds\n\ncontrary. Had Jesus, their Saviour, been with them, they would have\n\nfelt safe. All through the long and tedious night they bend to their\n\noars, forcing their way against wind and waves. They are beset with\n\ndanger and horror. These were strong men, accustomed to hardships\n\nand perils, and not easily intimidated with danger.\n\nThey had expected to take their Saviour on board the ship at a\n\ncertain designated point, but how could they even reach that spot\n\nwithout Him? All [seemed] in vain, [for] the wind was against them.\n\nThe strength of the rowers was exhausted, and yet the merciless\n\nstorm had not abated, but was lashing the waves into a fury as\n\nthough to engulf the boat and themselves. Oh, how they longed for\n\nJesus. In the hour of their greatest peril, when they had given up all\n\nfor lost, amid the lightning flashes in the fourth watch of the night\n\nJesus is revealed to them walking upon the water. Oh, then, Jesus\n\nhad not forgotten them. His watchful eye of tender sympathy and\n\npitying love had watched them all through that fearful storm. In their\n\ngreatest need He was close by them....\n\nAt the very point when despair was taking the place of hope,\n\nwhen they felt that they were utterly deserted, the eye of the world’s\n\nRedeemer was watching them with a compassion that was as tender\n\nas a mother watching over a suffering child, and this love is infinite.\n\nThe disciples were at first affrighted, but above the roaring of the\n\nangry tempest is heard the words the disciples longed most to hear,\n\n“Be of good cheer, it is I; be not afraid.” Their confidence is restored.\n\n504\n\nJesusWalksWithUsThroughAllTheStormsOfLife,August 23 505\n\n“Jesus; it is Jesus!” was spoken from one to the other. “Be not afraid;\n\nit is Jesus, the Master.”\n\nJesus said to winds and waves, to the troubled waters, “Peace,\n\nbe still.” Oh, how many times have we in our experience been in\n\na similar position as were these disciples. How many times has\n\nChrist revealed Himself to us and turned our sorrow into joy. Oh,\n\npowerful Redeemer, gracious and compassionate Saviour, able with\n\nThine infinite power to calm all tempests, able to revive all hearts.\n\nHe is our Redeemer.

Psalm 28:7.\n\nThe Lord Jesus came to the world to live the life that it will\n\nbe for the interest of every being on earth to live—that of humble\n\nobedience. Those to whom Christ has given a probation in which to\n\nform characters for the mansions He has gone to prepare are to enter\n\ninto His life example. If they are indeed learners in the school of\n\nChrist, they will not exalt themselves because they are possessors of\n\nhouses and lands, because the Lord has in His providence lent them\n\nHis goods to trade upon....\n\nChrist took upon Him human nature, that He might be able to\n\nsympathize with all hearts.... His spirit was never so full of worldly\n\ncares that He had no time or thought for the heavenly. He could\n\ngive evidence of His cheerfulness by singing psalms and heavenly\n\nsongs. The people of Nazareth often heard His voice raised in praise\n\nand thanksgiving to God. He often held communion with heaven in\n\nsong, and all who were associated with Him, who often complained\n\nof their weariness of labor, were cheered by the sweet melody that\n\nfell from His lips. His praises seemed to drive away the evil angels\n\nand, as incense, filled the room with sweet fragrance.\n\nThis, too, had its lesson. It taught that people could commune\n\nwith God in words of holy song. Christ carried the minds of His\n\nhearers away from their earthy exile to their future eternal home....\n\nThe house of God may be very humble in comparison with the\n\ntemple of Solomon, but it is no less acknowledged by God. To those\n\nwho worship there it is the gate of heaven, if they worship God in\n\nspirit and in truth, and in the beauty of holiness.

This will fit the dwellers of earth for the mansions\n\nChrist has gone to prepare for them that love Him.

In purity and holiness, con-\n\nnected with God, and beloved by God, He began where the first\n\nAdam began. But the first Adam was in every way more favorably\n\nsituated than was Christ. The wonderful provision made in Eden for\n\nthe holy pair was made by a God who loved them. Everything in\n\nnature was pure and undefiled. Fruits, flowers, and beautiful, lofty\n\ntrees flourished in the Garden of Eden. With everything that Adam\n\nand Eve required, they were abundantly supplied.\n\nBut Satan came, and insinuated doubts of God’s wisdom. He\n\naccused Him, their heavenly Father and Sovereign, of selfishness,\n\nbecause to test their loyalty, He had prohibited them from eating\n\nthe fruit of the tree of knowledge. Eve fell under the temptation,\n\nand Adam accepted the forbidden fruit from his wife’s hand. He\n\nfell under the smallest test that the Lord could devise to prove his\n\nobedience, and the floodgates of woe were opened upon our world.\n\nHe was furnished with a holy nature, sinless, pure, undefiled; but\n\nhe fell because he listened to the suggestions of the enemy; and his\n\nposterity became depraved....\n\nWhen Christ came, He entered a world disloyal to God, a world\n\nall seared and marred by the curse of rebellion against the Creator.\n\nThe archdeceiver had carried on his work with intense vigor, until\n\nthe curse of transgression had fallen upon the earth. People were\n\ncorruptedbySatan’sinventions.... Claimingforhimselftheattributes\n\nof mercy, goodness, and truth, Satan attributed his own attributes to\n\nGod.

The stern conflict between light and darkness, between\n\nerror and truth, is deepening in its intensity.

Every human mind that is not\n\nsurrendered to God, and is not under the control of the Spirit of God,\n\nwill be perverted through satanic agencies.\n\nThe enemy is working continually to supplant Jesus Christ in the\n\nhuman heart, and to place his attributes in the human character in\n\nthe place of the attributes of God. He brings his strong delusions to\n\nbear upon the human mind in order that he may have a controlling\n\npower. He seeks to obliterate the truth and abolish the true pattern\n\nof goodness and righteousness, in order that the professed Christian\n\nworld shall be swept to perdition through separation from God.

John 17:3.\n\nThe Lord Jesus said to His disciples when He was with them,\n\n“I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them\n\nnow.” He could have made disclosures which would have absorbed\n\nthe attention of the disciples and caused them to lose sight of His\n\nformer instruction that He wished to be the subject of their most\n\nearnest thought. But He withheld those things that they would have\n\nbeen amazed to hear, and that would have afforded them opportunity\n\nto cavil, to create misunderstanding and disaffection. He would\n\ngive no occasion for persons of little faith and piety to mystify and\n\nmisrepresent the truth, and thus create factions.\n\nJesus could have presented mysteries that would have given\n\nsubject for thought and investigation for generations, even to the\n\nclose of time. Himself the source of all true science, He could have\n\nled people to the investigation of mysteries, and age after age their\n\nminds wouldhave been so thoroughly absorbedthat they wouldhave\n\nfelt no desire to eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of God.\n\nJesus wellknewthatSatan is constantlyworking to excite curios-\n\nity, and to busy people with conjecture. Thus he seeks to eclipse the\n\ngrand and momentous truth that Christ wished to be ever prominent\n\nbefore their minds. “For this is life eternal, that they might know\n\nthee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”\n\nThere is a lesson for us in those words of Christ spoken after the\n\nfeeding of the five thousand. He said, “Gather up the fragments that\n\nremain, that nothing be lost.” These words meant more than that the\n\ndisciples shouldgatherthe broken pieces ofbreadinto baskets. Jesus\n\nmeant that they should mark His words, should study the Scriptures,\n\nand treasure every ray of light.

    "content": "Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him\n\nthat was dead, saith unto him, Lord ... he hath been dead four\n\ndays. John 11:39.\n\nChrist alone was able to bear the afflictions of the many. “In all\n\ntheir affliction he was afflicted.” He never bore disease in His own\n\nflesh, but He carried the sickness of others. With tenderest sympathy\n\nHe looked upon the suffering ones who pressed about Him. He\n\ngroaned in spirit as He saw the work of Satan revealed in all their\n\nwoe, and He made every case of need and of sorrow His own.... The\n\npower of love was in all His healing. He identified His interests with\n\nsuffering humanity.\n\nChrist was health and strength in Himself, and when sufferers\n\nwere in His immediate presence, disease was always rebuked. It\n\nwas for this that He did not go at once to Lazarus. He could not\n\nwitness his suffering and not bring him relief. He could not witness\n\ndisease or death without combating the power of Satan. The death\n\nof Lazarus was permitted that through his resurrection the last and\n\ncrowning evidence might be given to the Jews that Jesus was the\n\nSon of God.\n\nAnd in all this conflict with the power of evil, there was ever\n\nbeforeChristthedarkenedshadowintowhichHeHimselfmustenter.\n\nEver before Him was the means by which He must pay the ransom\n\nfor these souls. As He witnessed the suffering of humanity, He knew\n\nthat He must bear a greater pain, mingled with mockery, that He\n\nwould suffer the greatest humiliation. When He raised Lazarus from\n\nthe dead, He knew that for that life He must pay the ransom on the\n\ncross of Calvary....\n\nChrist was strong to save the whole world. He wept at the\n\ngrave of Lazarus at the thought that He could not save everyone\n\nwhom Satan’s power had laid low in death.... From the light of His\n\nexalted purity, the world’s Redeemer could see that the maladies\n\n524\n\nChristIdentifiesWithOurSorrows,September 1 525\n\nfrom which the human family were suffering were brought upon\n\nthem by transgression of the law of God. Every case of suffering He\n\ncould trace back to its cause.... He knew that He alone could rescue\n\nthem from the pit into which they had fallen. He alone could place\n\ntheir feet in the right path. His perfection alone could avail for their\n\nimperfection. He alone could cover their nakedness with His own\n\nspotless robe of righteousness....\n\nBy actual experience He knew nothing of sin; He stood before\n\nthe world the spotless Lamb of God. When suffering humanity\n\npressed about Him, He who was in the health of perfect manhood\n\nwas as one afflicted with them. This was essential, that He might\n\nexpress His perfect love in behalf of humanity.—Manuscript 18,\n\n1898."

    "content": "Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the\n\nleper, there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box\n\nof very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat\n\nat meat. Matthew 26:6, 7.\n\nThis incident is full of instruction. Jesus, the world’s Redeemer,\n\nis drawing close to the time when He will give His life for a sinful\n\nworld. Yet how little did even His disciples realize what they were\n\nabouttolose. Marycouldnotreasonuponthissubject. Herheartwas\n\nfilled with pure, holy love. The sentiment of her heart was “What\n\nshall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits toward me?” This\n\nointment, costly as it was estimated by the disciples, was but a poor\n\nexpression of her love for her Master. But Christ could appreciate\n\nthe gift as an expression of her love, and Mary’s heart was filled\n\nwith perfect peace and happiness.\n\nChrist delights in the earnest desire of Mary to do the will of her\n\nLord. He accepts the wealth of pure affection which His disciples\n\ndid not, could not, understand.... Mary’s ointment was the gift of\n\nlove, and this gave it its value in the eyes of Christ.... Jesus saw\n\nMary shrink away abashed, expecting to hear reproof from the One\n\nshe loved and worshiped. But instead of this she hears words of\n\ncommendation. “Why trouble ye the woman?” He said, “for she\n\nhath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always\n\nwith you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured\n\nthis ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say\n\nunto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole\n\nworld, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a\n\nmemorial of her.” No other anointing would Jesus receive, for the\n\nSabbathwas nighathand, andthey keptthe Sabbathaccording to the\n\ncommandment....

It was the love of Christ that constrained her....\n\nMary, by the Holy Spirit’s power, saw in Jesus One who had\n\ncome to seek and to save the souls that were ready to perish.

Matthew 21:2, 3.\n\nThe time of Christ’s triumphal entry into Jerusalem was the most\n\nbeautiful season of the year. The Mount of Olives was carpeted with\n\ngreen, and the groves were beautiful with varied foliage. Very many\n\nhad come to the feast from the regions round about Jerusalem with\n\nan earnest desire to see Jesus. The crowning miracle of the Saviour\n\nin raising Lazarus from the dead had a wonderful effect upon minds,\n\nand a large and enthusiastic multitude was drawn to the place where\n\nJesus was tarrying.\n\nThe afternoon was half spent when Jesus sent His disciples\n\nto the village of Bethphage.... This was the first time during His\n\nlife of ministry that Christ had consented to ride, and the disciples\n\ninterpreted this move to be an indication that He was about to assert\n\nHis kingly power and authority, and take His position on David’s\n\nthrone. Joyfully they executed the commission. They found the colt\n\nas Jesus had said....\n\nAs Jesus takes His seat on the animal, the air becomes vocal with\n\nacclamations of praise and triumph.... He bears no outward sign of\n\nroyalty. He wears no dress of state, nor is He followed by a train of\n\nmen of arms. Instead He is surrounded by a company wrought up\n\nto the highest pitch of excitement. They cannot restrain the joyous\n\nfeeling of expectancy that animate their hearts....\n\nThe shout echoes from mountain and valley, “Hosanna to the son\n\nof David: ...

It is a picture of\n\nunsurpassed loveliness, and well might the people apply to her the\n\nwords of the prophet, “A crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord,\n\nand a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.” At the entrancing sight,\n\nthe throng joins with renewed fervor in their shouts of praise.... They\n\nsuppose that Christ is now to take the throne of David and reign as a\n\ntemporal prince. Their eyes turn to Him to see how He is impressed\n\nby the scene. But lo, the Son of man is in tears!\n\nAs Christ’s eyes rest upon the temple, so soon to be desolated\n\nand its veil rent when the final act of the Jews would consummate\n\nHis death, He wept over the disobedient city.... In a few short hours\n\nthe world’s Redeemerwouldbe taken bywickedhands andcrucified.\n\nNot the Roman nation, not the Gentiles, but the people for whom\n\nHe had done so much, and from whom He had hoped for so much,\n\nwere to be His murderers....\n\nThe grace that bringeth salvation would no longer be heard in the\n\ncity.

Christ answered them, “If these should hold their peace,\n\nthe stones would immediately cry out.”\n\nChrist had come to earth to reveal the principles of the kingdom\n\nof heaven. His character as Saviour and Life-giver had been demon-\n\nstrated only a short time before at the grave of Lazarus, but in their\n\npride the Jews rejected the One who was mighty and having salva-\n\ntion.

Jesus said, “It\n\nis written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have\n\nmade it a den of thieves.”\n\nThis act on the part of Christ was deeply significant, more sig-\n\nnificant than any of the beholders realized. When the priests and\n\nPharisees had recovered from the terror that had taken possession of\n\ntheir guilty souls at the words of Christ, they returned to the temple.\n\nThey were not converted or even humbled. They determined to chal-\n\nlenge Christ as to His authority for expelling them from the temple\n\ncourts. When they reached the temple they found that a wonderful\n\nwork had been done during their absence. The sick and dying had\n\nbeen restored to health.

And presently the fig tree\n\nwithered away. Matthew 21:19.\n\nIt was not a common thing for a fig tree to present full foliage\n\nat that early period of the season. The fruit of the fig tree makes\n\nits appearance before the leaves; therefore a fig tree in full leaf\n\nmight be expected to have fruit upon it. Christ approached the tree,\n\nexpecting to find fruit there, but searching from the lowest bough to\n\nthe topmost branch, He found nothing but leaves, and His curse fell\n\nupon it.\n\nThis instance in the ministry of Christ is a singular one. It\n\nwas unlike the ways and works of Christ.... Wherever He went He\n\nscattered mercy in words of counsel and deeds of goodness. He was\n\nthe Restorer, the Healer. He came not to condemn the world but\n\nthat the world through Him might be saved.

John 15:2.\n\nI have been thinking about the lesson that Christ gave to His\n\ndisciples just prior to His entering the Garden of Gethsemane, know-\n\ning it would be His last opportunity to instruct His disciples before\n\nHis crucifixion. He says to them, as He points to a vine—and the\n\nvine is something that the Jews greatly prized and respected and\n\nconsidered very beautiful—“I am the true vine, and my Father is the\n\nhusbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh\n\naway.”\n\nNow, here is something for us to study.... We have our oppor-\n\ntunities now to bear fruit; we can reveal that we are fruit-bearing\n\nbranches of the vine. And if we go on now in a careless and indif-\n\nferent manner, then what will be our position? He tells us He will\n\ntake us away, for we cannot do anything without Christ, and if we\n\nare as a dead branch and do not draw sap and nourishment from the\n\nliving Vine, we shall become withered branches. He says that every\n\nbranch that beareth fruit, He purgeth it (pruneth it), that it may bring\n\nforth more fruit....\n\nWe have the enemy in our world to contend with. We have the\n\npowers of darkness to meet. We have to be in this conflict as long\n\nas time shall last. Our Saviour was in the conflict with the powers\n\nof darkness, and the powers of darkness were in conflict with Him,\n\neven after He entered our world.

It was customary for those living in\n\nthe metropolis to accommodate strangers desirous of celebrating\n\nthe Passover. The message took the form of a command.

Luke 22:24.\n\nThe request of James and John to sit on the right and left of\n\nChrist’s throne had excited the indignation of the others. That the\n\ntwo brothers should presume to ask forthe highest position so stirred\n\nthetenthatalienationthreatened. Theyfeltthattheyweremisjudged,\n\nthat their fidelity and talents were not appreciated. Judas was the\n\nmost severe upon James and John.\n\nWhen the disciples entered the upper room, their hearts were\n\nfull of resentful feelings. Judas pressed next to Christ on the left\n\nside; John was on the right. If there was a highest place, Judas was\n\ndetermined to have it, and that place was thought to be next to Christ.\n\nAnd Judas was a traitor.\n\nAnother cause of dissension had arisen. At a feast it was custom-\n\nary for a servant to wash the feet of the guests, and on this occasion\n\npreparation had been made for the service. The pitcher, the basin,\n\nand the towel were there, but no servant was present, and it was the\n\ndisciples’ part to perform it. But each of the disciples, yielding to\n\nwounded pride, determined not to act the part of a servant....\n\nLooking at the disturbed countenances of His disciples, Christ\n\nrose from the table, and, laying aside His outer garment, which\n\nwould have impeded His movements, He took a towel and girded\n\nHimself....\n\nJudas was the first whose feet Jesus washed. Judas had already\n\nclosed the contract to deliver Jesus into the hands of the priests and\n\nscribes. Christ knew his secret. Yet He did not expose him. He\n\nhungered for his soul. His heart was crying, How can I give thee\n\nup? He hoped that His act in washing Judas’ feet would touch the\n\nheart of the erring disciple and save him from completing his act of\n\ndisloyalty. And for a moment the heart of Judas thrilled through and\n\n546\n\nIfWeWantToBeGreat,WeMustGiveHumbleService,September 12 547\n\nthrough with the impulse then and there to confess his sin.

The guilt of his soul would have been washed away\n\nby the atoning blood of Christ.

John 13:6.\n\nWhen Peter’s turn came, he was unable to restrain himself and\n\nexclaimed with astonishment, “Lord, dost thou wash my feet?”...\n\nCalmly Jesus replied, “What I do thou knowest not now; but\n\nthou shalt know hereafter.” Feeling keenly the humiliation of his\n\nLord, and filled with love and reverence for Him, Peter with great\n\nemphasis exclaimed, “Thou shalt never wash my feet.”\n\nSolemnly Jesus said to Peter, “If I wash thee not, thou hast no\n\npart with me.”\n\nA ray of light penetrated the mind of the disciple. He saw that\n\nthe service that he refused was the type of a higher cleansing—\n\nthe spiritual cleansing of mind and heart. He could not endure the\n\nthought of separation from Christ; that would have been death. “Not\n\nmy feet only,” he said, “but also my hands and my head.”\n\n“Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash\n\nhis feet, but is clean every whit.”...\n\nEverypersonwhocamefromthebathwasclean,butthesandaled\n\nfeet soon became dusty and again needed to be washed. So Peterand\n\nhis brethren had been washed in the great fountain opened for sin\n\nand uncleanness. Christ acknowledged them as His. But temptation\n\nhad led them into evil, and they still needed His cleansing grace.\n\nWhen Jesus girded Himself with a towel to wash the dust from their\n\nfeet, He desired by this very act to wash the alienation, jealousy, and\n\npride from their hearts. This was of far more consequence than the\n\nwashing of their dusty feet. With the spirit they had then, not one of\n\nthem was prepared ... to partake of the Paschal supper or to share\n\nin the memorial service that Christ was about to institute.

John 6:70, 71.\n\nJudas was one who exerted a large influence over the disciples.\n\nHe was of commanding appearance and had excellent qualifica-\n\ntions.

His energies were devoted to self-serving,\n\nself-exaltation, and the love of money....\n\nThat poor, independent soul, separate from the spirit and life of\n\nChrist, had a hard time.

The result will be that\n\npeople will become inhuman in their actions toward other people....\n\nIf the professed Christian world would take a lesson from the\n\nJews’ treatment of Christ, and resolve in God never themselves\n\nto tread over the same ground, they would not make themselves\n\nresponsible for the death of Christ in the person of His saints.\n\nA large company of the priests and elders accompanied Christ\n\nto Herod. And when Christ was brought before Herod, these priests\n\nand rulers and scribes were all speaking excitedly, bringing in their\n\naccusations against Him. But the tetrarch paid little regard to the\n\ncharges brought against Christ.

How compassionate His\n\nwarning! But the warning was resented. In self-sufficiency Peter\n\ndeclared confidently that he would never do what Christ had warned\n\nhim against. “Lord,” he said, “I am ready to go with thee, both\n\ninto prison, and to death.” His self-confidence proved his ruin. He\n\ntemptedSatan to tempthim, andhe fellunderthe arts ofthe wily foe.\n\nWhen Christ needed him most, he stood on the side of the enemy\n\nand openly denied his Lord.\n\nBut even when Peter was denying Him, Christ showed that He\n\nstill loved him. In the judgment hall, surrounded by those who were\n\nclamoring forHis life, Jesus thoughtofHis suffering, erring disciple,\n\nand turning, He looked at him. In that look Peter read the Saviour’s\n\nlove and compassion, and a tide of memories rushed over him.... He\n\nsaw that he was doing the very thing that he had declared he would\n\nnot do.... Once more he looked at his Master and saw a sacrilegious\n\nhand raised to smite Him in the face. Unable longer to endure the\n\nscene, he rushed heartbroken from the hall.\n\nHe pressed on in solitude and darkness, he knew not and cared\n\nnot whither. At last he found himself in Gethsemane. The scene of a\n\nfew hours before came vividly to his mind. He thought of how the\n\nSaviour, during His agony in the garden, had come for sympathy\n\nand comfort to those who had been so closely connected with Him\n\nin labor....\n\nOn the very spot where Jesus poured out His soul in agony, Peter\n\nfell upon his face and wished that he might die....

And because of their\n\nself-sufficiency they fall an easy prey to Satan’s devices. Those who\n\nrealize their weakness trust in a power higher than self. And while\n\nthey look to God, Satan has no power against them....\n\nThere are some lessons that will never be learned except through\n\nfailure. Peter was a better man after his fall....

All His life Christ had been\n\npublishing to a fallen world the good news of the Father’s mercy and\n\npardoning love. Salvation for the chief of sinners was His theme.\n\nBut now with the terrible weight of guilt He bears, He cannot see the\n\nFather’s reconciling face. The withdrawal of the divine countenance\n\nfrom the Saviour in this hour of supreme anguish pierced His heart\n\nwith a sorrow that can never be fully understood by us. So great was\n\nthis agony that His physical pain was hardly felt.\n\nSatan with his fierce temptations wrung the heart of Jesus. The\n\nSaviour could not see through the portals of the tomb. Hope did\n\nnot present to Him His coming forth from the grave a conqueror, or\n\ntell Him of the Father’s acceptance of the sacrifice. He feared that\n\nsin was so offensive to God that Their separation was to be eternal.\n\nChrist felt the anguish that the sinner will feel when mercy shall no\n\nlonger plead for the guilty race.

He so loved sinful people that He gave Himself\n\nin His Son, that they might have another opportunity, another trial,\n\nanother chance to show their obedience. He so loved men and\n\nwomen that in order to save them He gave His Son to the world, and\n\nin that gift He gave all heaven! This was the only provision God\n\ncould make. By this gift a way was provided for sinners to return to\n\ntheir loyalty.\n\nGod is calling upon all to behold the Lamb of God, which taketh\n\naway the sin of the world. Christ lifts the guilt of sin from the sinner,\n\nstanding Himself under the condemnation of the Lawgiver. He came\n\nto this world to live the law in humanity, that Satan’s charge that\n\n580\n\n“WoundedForOurTransgressions”,September 29 581\n\nhuman beings cannot keep the law of God might be demonstrated as\n\nfalse.\n\nHe kept the law in humanity, and when He was accused falsely\n\nby the Pharisees, He turned to them, asking with a voice of authority\n\nand power, “Which of you convinceth me of sin?” He came to reveal\n\nto the heavenly universe, to the worlds unfallen, and to sinful people,\n\nthat every provision had been made by God in behalf of humanity,\n\nand that through the imputed righteousness of Christ all who receive\n\nHim by faith can show theirloyalty by keeping the law. As repenting\n\nsinners lay hold of Christ as their personal Saviour, they are made\n\npartakers of the divine nature.—Manuscript 63, 1897."

John 15:18,\n\n19.\n\nThe followers of Christ should bear in mind that all the evil\n\nspeeches made against Christ, all the abuse that He received, they\n\nmust, as His followers, endure for His name’s sake. The piety of the\n\nchurch may professedly be of a high order, but when the truth of the\n\nWord of God is brought to bear upon the heart, and when conviction\n\nof truth is rejected and despised so that they may keep in friendship\n\nwith the majority, they place themselves ... as rejecters of truth and\n\nlight, on the side of the enemy. Satan stirs them up by a power from\n\nbeneath, with an intensity that reveals his enmity to God and His\n\nlaws. They enact human laws that are oppressive and galling....\n\nAs Christ was hated without cause, so will His people be hated\n\nwithout cause, merely because they are obedient to the command-\n\nments of God and do His works in the place of working directly\n\ncontrary to them. If He who was pure, holy, and undefiled, who did\n\ngood and only good in our world, was treated as a base criminal and\n\ncondemned to death without a vestige of evidence against Him, what\n\ncan His disciples expect but similar treatment, however faultless\n\nmay be their life and blameless their character? Human enactments,\n\nlaws manufactured by satanic agencies under a plea of goodness and\n\nrestriction of evil, will be exalted while God’s holy enactments are\n\ndespised and trampled underfoot....\n\nWe see how professedly righteous people can act out the spirit\n\nof Satan to carry their wicked purposes through envy and jealousy\n\nand religious bigotry.... There is no warfare between Satan and the\n\nsinner, between fallen angels and fallen humans.

But never had the service been performed with such\n\nconflicting feelings. The trumpets and musical instruments and the\n\nvoices of the singers were as loud and clear as usual, but a sense of\n\nstrangeness pervaded everything. One after another inquired about\n\nthe strange event that had taken place. Hitherto the Most Holy Place\n\nhad always been most sacredly guarded from intrusion....\n\nOnly once a year was it entered, and then by the high priest.\n\nBut now a curious horror was seen on many countenances, for this\n\napartment was open to all eyes. At the very moment that Christ\n\nhad expired, the heavy veil of tapestry, made of pure linen, and\n\nbeautifully wrought with scarlet and purple, had been rent from top\n\nto bottom. The place where Jehovah had met with the priest, to com-\n\nmunicate His glory, the place that had been God’s sacred audience\n\nchamber, lay open to every eye—a place no longer recognized by\n\nthe Lord.\n\nMany who at that time united in the services of the Passover\n\nnever again took part in them. Light was to shine into their hearts.\n\nThe disciples were to communicate to them the knowledge that the\n\ngreat Teacher had come.\n\nAccording to their practice, the people brought their sick and\n\nsuffering to the Temple courts, inquiring, Who can tell us of Jesus\n\nof Nazareth, the Healer? Some had come from far to see and hear\n\nHim.... They would not be turned away. But they were driven from\n\nthe Temple courts, and the people of Jerusalem could not fail to see\n\nthe contrast between this scene and the scenes of Christ’s life.\n\n586\n\nTempleServiceEndedAtDeathOfChrist,October 1 587\n\nOn every side was heard the cry “We want Christ, the Healer.” A\n\nworld without a Christ was blackness and darkness, not only to the\n\ndisciples and to the sick and suffering, but to the priests and rulers.\n\nThe Jewishleaders andeven the Roman authorities founditharderto\n\ndeal with a dead Christ than with a living Christ. The people learned\n\nthat Jesus had been put to death by the priests. Inquiries were made\n\nregarding His death. The particulars of His trial were kept as private\n\nas possible, but during the time that He was in the grave, His name\n\nwas on thousands of lips, and reports of His mock trial and of the\n\ninhumanity of the priests and rulers were circulated everywhere.—\n\nManuscript 111, 1897 (Manuscript Releases 12:417-419)."

And when\n\nJoseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen\n\ncloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out\n\nin the rock. Matthew 27:58-60.\n\nBy those of intellect the priests were called upon to explain the\n\nprophecies of the Old Testament concerning the Messiah, and while\n\ntrying to frame some falsehood in reply, the priests became like men\n\ninsane. Upon many minds the conviction rested that the Scriptures\n\nhad been fulfilled....\n\nJoseph was a disciple of Christ, but in the past he had not identi-\n\nfied himself with Him for fear of the Jews. He now went boldly to\n\nPilate and asked for the body of Christ. He was a rich man, and this\n\ngave him influence with the governor. Had he delayed, the body of\n\nthe Saviour would have been placed with the bodies of the thieves\n\nin a dishonored grave.\n\nNicodemus, a chief ruler and a rabbi, was also a disciple of\n\nChrist. He had come to the Saviour by night, as if afraid to have it\n\nknown that his heart was troubled. That night he listened to the most\n\nimportantdiscourse thateverfellfrom human lips. [See John 3.] The\n\nwords he heard had penetrated his soul. He had been enlightened\n\nby them, but still he had not identified himself with Christ. He had\n\nbeen among the number spoken of by John. “Among the chief rulers\n\nalso many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did\n\nnot confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue.” But\n\nNicodemus had endeavored, as far as he could, to defend Christ. On\n\none occasion he had asked the priests, “Doth our law judge any man,\n\nbefore it hear him, and know what he doeth?”...\n\nAfter the crucifixion Nicodemus came to the cross, bringing\n\na mixture of myrrh and aloes to embalm Christ’s body. He had\n\nwitnessed the cruel treatment of the priests; he had marked Christ’s\n\n588\n\nMenAndWomenToStandBoldlyForChrist,October 2 589\n\npatience and Godlike bearing, even in His humiliation. He now saw\n\nmore clearly the real character of the high priest, and he came boldly\n\nto take the bruised body of his Saviour, looked upon as the body of\n\na malefactor. Thus he identified himself with Christ in His shame\n\nand death.\n\nWith the death of Christ the hopes of the disciples had perished.\n\nOften they repeated the words “We trusted that it had been he which\n\nshould have redeemed Israel.”...

Matthew 28:2.\n\nIf, after His crucifixion and burial, in the place of giving way to\n\ntheir sorrow the disciples had carefully reviewed what Christ had\n\ntold them to prepare them for this time, they would have seen light\n\namid the darkness. They need not have been in such apparently\n\nhopeless discouragement.\n\nBefore anyone hadreachedthe sepulcher, there was a greatearth-\n\nquake. The mightiest angel from heaven, he who held the position\n\nfrom which Satan fell, received his commission from the Father,\n\nand, clothed with the panoply of heaven, he parted the darkness from\n\nhis track. His face was like lightning, and his garments white as\n\nsnow. As soon as his feet touched the ground it quaked beneath his\n\ntread. The Roman guards were keeping their weary watch when this\n\nwonderful scene took place, and they were enabled to endure the\n\nsight, for they had a message to bear as witnesses of the resurrection\n\nof Christ.\n\nThe angel approached the grave, rolled away the stone as though\n\nit had been a pebble, and sat upon it. The light of heaven encircled\n\nthe tomb, and the whole heaven was lighted by the glory of the\n\nangels. Then his voice was heard, “Thy Father calls thee, come\n\nforth.” And Jesus came forth from the grave with the step of a\n\nmighty Conqueror. There was a burst of triumph, for the heavenly\n\nfamily was waiting to receive Him, and the mighty angel, followed\n\nby the army of heaven, bowed in adoration before Him as He, the\n\nMonarch of heaven, proclaimed over the rent tomb of Joseph, “I am\n\nthe resurrection and the life.”\n\nWhen Christ upon the cross cried out, “It is finished,” there was\n\na mighty earthquake that rent open the graves of many who had been\n\nfaithful and loyal, bearing their testimony against every evil work,\n\n590\n\nThereIsAlwaysLightAmidDarkness,October 3 591\n\nand magnifying the Lord God of hosts. Now as the Life-giver came\n\nforth from the sepulcher, proclaiming, “I am the resurrection and the\n\nlife,” He summoned these saints from the grave. When alive, they\n\nhad, at the cost of their lives, borne their testimony unflinchingly for\n\nthe truth. Now they were to be witnesses of Him who had raised\n\nthem from the dead. These, said Christ, are no longer the captives of\n\nSatan. I have redeemed them; I have brought them from the grave\n\nas the firstfruits of My power, to be with me where I am, nevermore\n\nto see death or experience sorrow.—Manuscript 115, 1897."

Luke 24:6, 7.\n\nThe Sabbath was past, and Mary Magdalene came early in the\n\nmorning, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulcher. Other women\n\nwere to meet her there, but Mary was the first at the sepulcher. They\n\nhad prepared the sweet spices to anoint the body of their Lord. The\n\nwomen were greatly terrified, and buried their faces in the earth, for\n\nthe sight of the angels was more than they could endure. The angels\n\nwere compelled to hide their glory yet more decidedly before they\n\ncould converse with the women. The women trembled with awe.\n\nThe angels said, “Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which\n\nwas crucified. He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see\n\nthe place where the Lord lay.”...\n\nThere was no more weeping for Mary. Her heart was filled with\n\njoy and rejoicing....

Thus Christ\n\nmade an appointment for a public meeting with His followers in\n\nGalilee. Who was it that reminded the women who were seeking\n\nChrist in the tomb of what the Saviour had said to them previously?\n\nIt was Christ who had risen, as He had told them He would.\n\nIn this connection Mark gives a most precious statement that\n\nmustnotbe overlooked. The angelsaidto the women, “Go yourway,\n\ntell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee.”\n\nWhat a comforting message was thus given to the women to give to\n\nPeter. The last look Jesus had given Peter was after the disciple’s\n\n592\n\n“HeIsRisen!”,October 4 593\n\nthrice-repeated denial. Peter was not forgotten by Christ, and this\n\nmention of his name signified to him that he was forgiven....\n\nThe wonderful instruction that Christ had given His disciples\n\nwas neverto lose its force, but they had to be reminded of the lessons\n\nthat Christ had repeatedly given them while He was yet with them.\n\n“Remember,” said the angel, “how he spake unto you when he was\n\nyet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the\n\nhands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.”\n\nThe disciples were surprisedthattheyhadnotthoughtofthese things\n\nbefore.—Manuscript 115, 1897."

John 3:16.\n\nThe rebellion against God’s law was begun by Satan in heaven.\n\nBy this rebellion sin was brought into existence.... Satan insisted\n\nthat God had not dealt with him justly. He criticized God’s plan of\n\ngovernment. He declared the divine law to be arbitrary, detrimental\n\nto the interests of the heavenly universe, and in need of change.\n\nVital interests were at stake in the worlds that God had created.\n\nWould these supposed defects be made so apparent that the inhabi-\n\ntants of the heavenly universe would be justified in claiming that the\n\nlaw could be improved? Would Satan succeed in undermining their\n\nconfidence in the law?\n\nGod in His wisdom did not use measures of force to suppress\n\nSatan’s rebellion. Such measures would have aroused sympathy for\n\nSatan, strengtheninghisrebellionratherthanchanginghisprinciples.\n\nIf God had summarily punished him, many would have looked upon\n\nhim as one who had been dealt with unjustly, and he would have\n\ncarried a much larger number with him in his apostasy.\n\nIt was necessary to give Satan time to develop his principles. He\n\nhas had every opportunity to present his side of the question. He has\n\nbeen artful. As often as his position has been seen in its true light, he\n\nhas changed to some other position. By making false charges, and\n\nby misstating the purposes and declared will of God, he has secured\n\nsympathizers.\n\nAdam and Eve were placed on trial and failed.... Satan deceived\n\nEve, and she disobeyed God. The holy pair, not resisting tempta-\n\ntion, were brought under Satan’s jurisdiction.

    "content": "From the manger to the cross Satan followed the Son of God.\n\nTemptations beat upon Him like a tempest. But the more fierce\n\nthe conflict, the more familiar He became with the temptations\n\nwherewith human beings are beset, and the better prepared He was\n\nto succor the tempted. The severity of the trial through which Christ\n\npassed was proportionate to the value of the object to be gained or\n\nlost by His success or failure. Not merely the interests of one world\n\nwere involved. This world was the battlefield, but all the worlds that\n\nGod had created were affected by the result of the conflict.\n\nIn order that he might reign as supreme ruler, Satan sought to\n\noverthrow Christ. And he planned and carried out the murder of\n\nChrist forno otherreason than that to the last he entertained the hope\n\nthat Christ would not endure a death made as horrible as infernal\n\nwisdom could make it. He endeavored to prove the correctness of\n\nhis assertion that Christ was not self-sacrificing.\n\nActuated by satanic influences, the crowd clamored for the cruci-\n\nfixion of Christ. All heaven watched the successive steps of Christ’s\n\nhumiliation—His trial, rejection, and death. When on the cross He\n\nexclaimed, “It is finished,” the warfare was ended. The blood of the\n\nInnocent was shed for the guilty. The life that He gave up ransomed\n\nthe human race from eternal death and sealed the doom of him who\n\nhad the power of death—the devil.\n\nSatansoughttomakeitappearthathewasworkingfortheliberty\n\nof the universe. Even while Christ was on the cross, the enemy\n\nwas determined to make his arguments so varied, so deceptive, so\n\ninsidious, that all would be convinced that God’s law was tyrannical.\n\nHe himself laid every scheme, planned every evil, inflamed every\n\nmind to bring affliction on Christ. He himself instigated the false\n\naccusations against One who had done only good. He himself\n\n604\n\nAllCreationAffectedByTheGreatControversy,October 10 605\n\ninspired the cruel deeds that added to the suffering of the Son of\n\nGod—the pure, the holy, the innocent.\n\nBy this course of action Satan has forged a chain by which he\n\nhimself will be bound. The heavenly universe will bear witness to\n\nthe justice of God in punishing him. Heaven itself saw what heaven\n\nwould be if he were in it. The hearts of all in the heavenly universe\n\nwere united in regarding God’s law as changeless. They supported\n\nthe government of Him who, to redeem the transgressor, spared not\n\nHis own Son from suffering the penalty of sin.\n\nIn His ministry, Christ by word and deed vindicated the honor\n\nof God’s law. It was for this purpose that He came into the world.—\n\nManuscript 1, 1902."

Psalm 119:34.\n\nWhen Christ ascended and laid open before the heavenly intelli-\n\ngences the scene of the conflict and the fierce attacks that Lucifer\n\nmade against Him to prevent Him from accomplishing His work\n\non the earth, all the prevarications and accusations of him who had\n\nbeen an exalted angel were seen in their true light. It was seen that\n\nhis professedly spotless character was deceptive. His deeply laid\n\nscheme to exalt himself to supremacy was now fully discerned....\n\nWhen the issue was finally settled, every unfallen being expressed\n\nindignation at the rebellion. With one voice they extolled God as\n\nrighteous, merciful, self-denying, just. His law had been vindicated.\n\nIn the beginning Satan’s purpose was to separate the human\n\nfamily from God. And in every age he has carried out this same\n\npurpose. The same method of deception, the same logic that he used\n\nto deceive the holy pair in Eden, he has used in all succeeding ages.\n\nHis plan of work has ever been one of deception. He claims to be\n\nreligious. He has a synagogue in which there are worshipers.... He\n\nsways all classes.\n\nConstantly Satan works among people of all ages. At times he\n\nassumes a cloak of piety, purity, and holiness. Often he transforms\n\nhimself into an angel of light. He has blinded the eyes of men and\n\nwomen so that they cannot see beneath the surface and discern his\n\nreal purposes.\n\nGod is omnipotent, omniscient, immutable. He always pursues a\n\nstraightforward course. His law is truth—unchanging, eternal truth.\n\nHis precepts are consistent with His attributes. But Satan makes\n\nthem appear in a false light. By perverting them he seeks to give\n\nhuman beings an unfavorable impression of God. Throughout his\n\nrebellion he has sought to represent God as an unjust, tyrannical\n\nbeing.\n\n606\n\nGod’sLawFinallyVindicated,October 11 607\n\nBut Satan’s hypocrisy has been unmasked by Christ’s life, trial,\n\nand death. Christ took upon Himself human nature, and by His per-\n\nfect life demonstrated the falsity of the claims of him who constantly\n\naccuses those who are trying to obey God’s law. And the blood of\n\nChrist shed on the cross is the everlasting, incontrovertible testi-\n\nmony that God’s law is as immutable as is His own character. The\n\ncrucifixion of Christ was a murder instigated by Satan and carried\n\nout by people who had separated themselves from God. In the day\n\nof judgment, when the death of Christ upon the cross is seen in all\n\nits reality, every voice will be hushed.

Psalm 24:9.\n\nChrist longed for careworn, oppressed, weary human beings to\n\ncome to Him, that He might give them the light and life and joy and\n\npeace that is to be found nowhere else. The veriest sinners were\n\nthe objects of His deep, earnest interest, pity, and love. But when\n\nin the greatest need of human sympathy, in the hour of His greatest\n\ntrial and heaviest temptation, the most promising of His disciples\n\nleft Him. He was indeed compelled to tread the winepress alone,\n\nand of the people there was none with Him. An atmosphere of\n\napostasy surrounded Him. On every side could be heard sounds of\n\nmockery, taunting, and blasphemy. What then was the outlook for\n\nHis disciples, left in a world that would not tolerate the Son of the\n\nliving God? ...\n\nChrist’s work was finished when He expired on the cross, crying\n\nwith a loud voice, “It is finished.” The way was laid open; the veil\n\nwas rent in twain. Sinners could approach God without sacrificial\n\nofferings, without the service of a priest. Christ Himself was a priest\n\nforever after the order of Melchizedek. Heaven was His home. He\n\ncame to this world to reveal the Father. His work on the field of His\n\nhumiliation and conflict was now done. He ascended up into the\n\nheavens, and is forever set down on the right hand of God....\n\nIn Joseph’s tomb He wrapped Himself in the garment of immor-\n\ntality, and then waited in the world for a sufficient length of time to\n\nput beyond doubt the evidence that He was indeed risen from the\n\ndead.... He rose from the dead to become familiar with His disciples\n\npreparatory to His ascension, when He should be glorified before\n\nthe heavenly universe....\n\nAll heaven waited with eager earnestness for the end of the\n\ntarrying of the Son of God in a world all seared and marred with\n\n610\n\nHeaven’sTriumphalReceptionOfChrist,October 13 611\n\nthe curse of transgression. He ascended from the Mount of Olives\n\nin a cloud of angels, who triumphantly escorted Him to the City\n\nof God.... What a contrast was Christ’s reception on His return to\n\nheaven to His reception on this earth.... There was no sorrow, no\n\nsuffering, to meet Him at every turn. There were no scowling priests\n\nto exercise their ingenuity in finding some word of His that they\n\ncould misinterpret and thus gain opportunity to harass, abuse, insult,\n\nand deride Him....\n\nIn proportion to Christ’s humiliation and suffering is His exalta-\n\ntion.

Luke 24:49.\n\nHaving magnified the law and made it honorable by accepting\n\nits conditions in saving a world from ruin, Christ hastened to heaven\n\nto perfect His work, and to accomplish His mission by sending the\n\nHoly Spirit to His disciples. Thus He would assure His believing\n\nones that He had not forgotten them, though now in the presence of\n\nGod where there is fullness of joy forevermore.\n\nThe Holy Spirit was to descend on those in this world who\n\nloved Christ. By this they would be qualified, in and through the\n\nglorification of their Head, to receive every endowment necessary\n\nfor the fulfilling of their mission. The Life-giver held in His hands\n\nnot only the keys of death but a whole heaven of rich blessings. All\n\npower in heaven and earth was given to Him, and having taken His\n\nplace in the heavenly courts, He could dispense these blessings to\n\nall who receive Him....\n\nThe Holy Spirit was sent as the most priceless treasure the world\n\ncould receive. The church was baptized with the Spirit’s power.\n\nThe disciples were fitted to go forth and proclaim Christ, first in\n\nJerusalem, where the shameful work of dishonoring the rightful\n\nKing had been done, and then to the uttermost parts of the earth. The\n\nevidence of the enthronement of Christ in His mediatorial kingdom\n\nwas given....\n\nThe Father gave all honor to His Son, seating Him at His right\n\nhand, far above all principalities and powers.

And\n\nthey talked together of all these things which had happened.\n\nLuke 24:13, 14.\n\nOn the first day of the week after Christ’s crucifixion, the disci-\n\nples had everything to fill their hearts with rejoicing. But this day\n\nwas not a day of joy to all. To some it was a day of uncertainty,\n\nconfusion, and perplexity.... The women brought tidings that ... pos-\n\nitively affirmed that Christ had risen from the dead, and that they\n\nthemselves had seen Jesus alive in the garden.\n\nBut still the disciples seemed unbelieving. Their hopes had died\n\nwith Christ. And when the news of His resurrection was brought to\n\nthem, it was so different from what they had anticipated that they\n\ncould not believe it.... From eyewitnesses some of the disciples had\n\nobtained quite a full account of the events of Friday. Others beheld\n\nthe scenes of the crucifixion with their own eyes. In the afternoon of\n\nthe first day of the week, two of the disciples, restless and unhappy,\n\ndecided to return to their home in Emmaus, a village about eight\n\nmiles from Jerusalem....\n\nThey had not advanced far on their journey when they were\n\njoined by a stranger.

But He must first give them lessons\n\nthat they would never forget....\n\nThey told Him of their disappointment in regard to their Master,\n\n“how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned\n\nto death, and have crucified him.” With hearts sore with disappoint-\n\n614\n\nTwoDisciplesWentFromDespairToHope,October 15 615\n\nment and with quivering lips they said, “We trusted that it had been\n\nhe which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, today is\n\nthe third day since these things were done.”\n\nWhy did not the disciples remember Christ’s words, and realize\n\nthat events were to be as they had been? Why did not they realize\n\nthat the last part of His disclosure would be just as verily fulfilled as\n\nthe first part, that the third day He would rise again? This was the\n\npart they should have remembered. The priests and rulers did not\n\nforget this.—Manuscript 113, 1897."

For the first time\n\nsince Christ’s betrayal in the garden, they began to feel hopeful.\n\nOften they looked earnestly at their Companion, and thought that\n\nHis words were just the words that Christ would have spoken. They\n\nwere filled with amazement, and their hearts began to throb with\n\nexpectation, hope, and joy....\n\nThere are many who discount Old Testament history. They\n\nadvocate the idea that the New Testament takes the place of the Old,\n\nand that therefore the Old Testament is no longer of any use. But\n\nChrist’s first work with His disciples was to begin at the Alpha of\n\nthe Old Testament to prove that He was to come to this world and\n\npass through the experiences that had taken place in His incarnation.\n\nThe rejection of the Son of God was plainly seen by the prophets....\n\nChrist would have the ideas of His disciples pure and true in ev-\n\nery specification. They must understand, as far as possible, in regard\n\nto the cup of suffering that was apportioned to Him. He showed\n\nthem that the awful conflict that they could not yet understand, but\n\nthat they should understand, was the fulfillment of the covenant\n\nmade before the foundation of the world was laid.

Luke 24:45.\n\nThe sayings of Christ are to be valued, not merely in accordance\n\nwith the measure of the understanding of those who hear; they are to\n\nbe considered in the important bearing that Christ Himself attaches\n\nto them. He took the old truths, of which He Himself was the\n\noriginator, and placed them before His hearers in heaven’s own light.\n\nHow different was their representation. What a flood of meaning\n\nand brightness and spirituality was brought in by their explanation.\n\nAfter His resurrection Christ opened the understanding of His\n\nfollowers, that they might understand the Scriptures. Everything\n\nhad been transformed by the working of the arts of Satan. Truth\n\nwas covered up by the rubbish of error, and hidden from finite sight.\n\nWhen Christ referred to His humiliation, rejection, and crucifixion,\n\nthe disciples could not take in His meaning. It had been a part of\n\ntheir education to expect Christ to set up a temporal kingdom, and\n\nwhen He spoke of His sufferings they could not understand His\n\nwords....\n\nChrist had many truths to give to His disciples of which He\n\ncould not speak, because they did not advance with the light that was\n\nflashed upon the Levitical laws and the sacrificial offerings. They\n\ndid not embrace the light, advance with the light, and follow on to\n\nstill greater brightness as Providence should lead the way.\n\nAnd for the same reason Christ’s disciples today do not compre-\n\nhend important matters of truth. So dull has been the comprehension\n\nof even those who teach the truth to others that many things cannot\n\nbe opened to them until they reach heaven. It ought not to be so.\n\nBut as minds become narrow, they think they know it all, and set\n\none stake after another in points of truths of which they have only\n\na glimpse. People close their minds as though there were no more\n\n622\n\nJesusOpenedTheUnderstandingOfHisFollowers,October 19 623\n\nfor them to learn, and should the Lord attempt to lead them on they\n\nwould not take up with the increased light. They cling to the spot\n\nwhere they think they see a glimmer of light, when it is only a link\n\nin the living chain of truths and promises to be studied....\n\nThe development of truth will be the reward to the humble-\n\nhearted seeker who will fear God and walk with Him. The truth\n\nthat the mind grasps as truth is capable of constant expansion and\n\nnew development.... As the mind grasps it in its preciousness, it\n\nbecomes elevated, ennobled, and sanctified.—Manuscript 143, 1897\n\n(Manuscript Releases 16:122, 123)."

Acts 1:8.\n\nAfter His resurrection, Christ ascended to His appointed honor.\n\nBefore the heavenly universe and the worlds unfallen He was to be\n\nenthroned. The Father would impress the minds of the believers\n\nwith the glorious reception of His Son in the home He had left. For\n\nour sake He became poor, that we through His poverty might be\n\nmade rich....\n\nAs Christ ascended, His hands were outstretched in blessing\n\nupon His disciples. While they stood gazing upward to catch the last\n\nglimpse of their ascending Lord, He was received by the heavenly\n\nthrong into the rejoicing ranks of cherubs and seraphs. And as they\n\nescorted Him to His heavenly home, they sang in triumph, “Sing\n\nunto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; ...\n\nthat rideth upon the heavens of heavens.”\n\nChrist determined to bestow a gift on those who had been with\n\nHim and on those who should believe on Him, because this was\n\nthe occasion of His ascension and inauguration, a jubilee in heaven.\n\nWhat gift could Christ bestow rich enough to signalize and grace\n\nHis ascension to the mediatorial throne? It must be worthy of His\n\ngreatness and His royalty. Christ gave His representative, the third\n\nperson of the Godhead, the Holy Spirit. This Gift could not be\n\nexcelled....\n\nOn the day of Pentecost Christ gave His disciples the Holy Spirit\n\nas their Comforter. It was ever to abide with His church. During the\n\nwhole Jewish economy the influence of this Spirit has often been\n\nrevealed in a marked manner, but not in full.

Now for ten days the disciples sent\n\nup their petitions, and Christ in heaven added His intercession. He\n\nclaimed the gift of the Spirit, that He might pour it out upon His\n\npeople.... [Christ] having reached His throne, the Spirit was given\n\nas He had promised, and like a rushing, mighty wind, it fell upon\n\nthose assembled, filling the whole house. It came with a fullness and\n\npower, as if for ages it had been restrained, but was now poured forth\n\nupon the church, to be communicated to the world. What followed\n\nthis outpouring?

With amazement they heard the clear, bold\n\ntestimony given under the power of the Holy Spirit. The words\n\nand works of the disciples represented the words and works of their\n\nTeacher, and all who heard them said, They have learned of Jesus;\n\nthey talk as He talked. “And with great power gave the apostles\n\nwitness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was\n\nupon them all.”\n\nThe chief priests and rulers thought themselves competent to\n\ndecide what the apostles should do and teach.

There was\n\ndanger that the ideas and doctrines of the rabbis would be brought\n\ninto disrepute.\n\nThe apostles were creating a wonderful excitement.

This\n\nJesus was extolled above the priests and rulers. The apostles were\n\neven declaring that He had risen from the dead. The Jewish rulers\n\ndecided that this work must be stopped, for it was proving them\n\nguilty of the blood of Jesus.—Letter 38, 1896."

About what? About\n\nmatters that are not vital points at all, and that are regarded as such\n\nonly because people have given importance to them. See Matthew\n\n12:31-37; Mark 14:56; Luke 5:21; Matthew 9:3.\n\nBut let us follow the history of the men whom the Jewish priests\n\nand rulers thought so dangerous because they were bringing in new\n\nand strange teaching on almost every theological subject. The com-\n\nmand given by the Holy Spirit, “Go, stand and speak in the temple\n\nto the people all the words of life,” was obeyed by the apostles....\n\nIf the priests and rulers had dared act out their own feelings\n\ntoward the apostles, there would have been a different record, for\n\nthe angel of God was a watcher on that occasion, to magnify His\n\nname if any violence had been offered to His servants.\n\n“And when they had brought them, they set them before the\n\ncouncil: and the high priest asked them, saying, Did not we straitly\n\ncommand you that ye should not teach in this name? ... Then Peter\n\nand the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God\n\nrather than men.... And we are his witnesses of these things; and so\n\nis also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.\n\nWhen they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel\n\nto slay them.”\n\nThen the Holy Spirit moved upon Gamaliel, a Pharisee, a doctor\n\nof the law, who had a reputation among all the people. His advice\n\nwas “Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel\n\nor this work be of men, it will come to nought. But if it be of God,\n\nye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against\n\nGod.

Had\n\nPhilip left the eunuch with his case hanging in the balance, he might\n\nnever have accepted the Saviour. Evil angels were waiting for their\n\nopportunity when they could press in their falsehoods and divert the\n\nnewly awakened mind from seeking after truth. The Lord’s agencies\n\nmust be wholly consecrated to His service, that they may be quick to\n\nunderstand their work.

With power he bore witness that Christ\n\nwas a risen Saviour. To please the Jews, the Romans had crucified\n\nChrist, and now they sought still further to please them by placing\n\nJohn where his voice would not be heard by Jew or Gentile. He was\n\nbanished to the Isle of Patmos.\n\nApparently the Lord permitted His enemies to triumph, as far as\n\noutward appearance was concerned. But God’s hand was moving\n\nunseen in the darkness. God permitted His faithful servant to be\n\nplaced where Christ could give him a more wonderful revelation of\n\nHimself to give to the world.... He was hidden as it were on a desert\n\nisland, and here Christ visited him, giving him a most wonderful\n\nview of His glory, and making known to him what was to come upon\n\nthe earth....\n\nJohn was deprived of the society of his brethren and of the\n\npleasure of association. But no one could deprive him of the light\n\nand revelation of Christ. A great light was to shine from Christ to\n\nHis servant. Richly favored was this beloved disciple. With the other\n\ndisciples he had traveled with Jesus, learning of Him and feasting\n\non His words.... On the holy Sabbath day the risen Saviour made\n\nHis presence known to John; and the testimony then given him is\n\ngiven also to us. God would have us search the Scriptures, that we\n\nmay know what will be in the last days of this earth’s history....\n\n[Portions of Revelation 1 are quoted.] This is a most powerful\n\ntestimony, but its true significance is but dimly discerned.

It should\n\ngive living power to the church. At times dark clouds surround\n\nGod’s people. It seems as though oppression and persecution would\n\nextinguish them. But at such times the most instructive lessons\n\nare given. As in the darkest night the stars shine the brightest, so\n\nthe most brilliant beams of God’s glory are revealed in the deepest\n\ngloom.

Revelation 2:10.\n\nJohn had been closely associated with the Saviour during His\n\nlife of ministry. He had heard His wonderful words and had seen His\n\nwonderful deeds, and his testimony was given in clear lines. Out of\n\nthe abundance of a heart overflowing with love for Christ he spoke,\n\nand no power could stay his words....\n\nLike his Master, John patiently submitted to every attempt to\n\nput him to death. When his enemies cast him into the cauldron\n\nof boiling oil, they thought to hear no more from him. But as the\n\nwords of satanic origin were spoken, “Thus perish all who believe in\n\nthat deceiver, Jesus Christ of Nazareth,” John declared, “My Master\n\npatiently submitted to all that Satan and his angels could devise to\n\nhumiliate and torture Him. He gave His life to save the world. He\n\ndied that we might live. I am honored in being permitted to suffer\n\nfor His sake. I am only a weak, sinful man, but Christ was holy,\n\nharmless, undefiled, separate from sinners. He did no sin, neither\n\nwas guile found in His mouth.” John’s words, while suffering at the\n\nhands of his enemies, had an influence, and he was removed from\n\nthe cauldron by the very ones who had cast him in.\n\nIt was after this that John was sent to the Isle of Patmos, where,\n\nseparated from his companions in the faith, his enemies supposed\n\nthat he would die from hardship and neglect. But John made friends\n\nand converts even there. They thought that they had at last placed\n\nthe faithful witness where he could no longer trouble Israel or the\n\nwicked rulers of the world....\n\nGod and Christ and the heavenly host were John’s companions\n\non the Isle of Patmos. From them he received instruction that he\n\nimpartedto those separatedwithhim from the world. There he wrote\n\nout the visions and revelations he received from God, telling of the\n\n650\n\nGod’sMessageForHisPeople,November 1 651\n\nthings that would take place in the closing period of this earth’s\n\nhistory. When his voice would no longer witness for the truth,\n\nwhen he could no longer testify of the One he loved and served, the\n\nmessages given to him on that rocky, barren coast were to go forth\n\nas a lamp that burneth. Every nation, kindred, tongue, and people\n\nwould learn the sure purpose of the Lord, not concerning the Jewish\n\nnation merely, but every nation upon the earth.—Manuscript 150,\n\n1899."

He was separated\n\nfrom his companions in the faith, and cut off from his labors in the\n\ngospel; but he was not separated from the presence of God. The\n\ndesolate place of his exile proved to him to be the gate of heaven.\n\nHe says, “I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day”—the holy day that\n\nGod had blessed and set apart as His own—“and heard behind me a\n\ngreat voice, as of a trumpet, saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first\n\nand the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book....

It is an\n\neverlasting testimony that “God so loved the world, that he gave his\n\nonlybegottenSon,thatwhosoeverbelievethinhimshouldnotperish,\n\nbut have everlasting life.” It declares to the whole world that God\n\nwill never forget His people in their struggle with evil.—Manuscript\n\n100, 1893."

Matthew 7:14.\n\nThe mild, beloveddisciple [John] has said, “He thatsaith, I know\n\nhim, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is\n\nnot in him” (1 John 2:4). The Word of God is very plain and pointed.\n\nIt is dangerous business to profess to be a follower of Jesus and in\n\nworks deny Him by indifference to even one of His requirements.\n\nThe history of the Reformation teaches us that the church of\n\nChrist is never to come to a standstill and cease reforming. God\n\nstands at the head, saying to them as He did to Moses, “Go forward.”\n\n“Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.” God’s work\n\nis onward; step by step His people advance onward through conflict\n\nand trial to final victory. The history of the church teaches us that\n\nGod’s people are not to be stereotyped in their theories of faith, but\n\nto be prepared for new light, for opening truth revealed in His Word.\n\nThe past history of the advancement of truth amid error and\n\ndarkness shows us that sacred truth is not cherished and sought\n\nafter by the majority. Those who have advanced in reform, obeying\n\nthe voice of God—“Go forward” have been subject to opposition,\n\ntorture, and death; and in the face of gaping prisons and threatened\n\ntorture and death, they deemed the truth for their time of sufficient\n\nimportance to hold tenaciously, yielding their life rather than to\n\nsacrifice their faith. They counted not their life dear unto them if\n\nsacrificed for the truth of God. The truth in our day is as important\n\nas it was in the days of the martyrs....\n\nWhat if in Luther’s day people had taken a position to cover\n\ntheir disobedience to God’s requirement with: “God is too merciful\n\nto condemn me for not taking unpopular truth.

He therefore makes a plain statement to undeceive all\n\nminds that want to be undeceived upon this point....\n\nMen and women have died without keeping the seventh-day\n\nSabbath. They were good people and lived up to all the light they\n\nhad. They could not be responsible for the light that they never had.\n\nWe are accountable for the light that shines in our day. To excuse\n\nour transgression of God’s law because good people in generations\n\npast did not keep it would be folly....\n\nIt is never safe to be indifferent to light. If professedly great\n\nand good people do not obey the law of God, is it any reason we\n\nshould transgress? ... It was the scribes, the rulers, the priests, men\n\nin holy office, men who believed their righteousness was above the\n\nwhole world, who persecuted Christ. These pious pretenders were\n\n662\n\nDangerOfIndifferenceToLight,November 7 663\n\nthe fiercest persecutors Jesus had....

If they had known that He\n\nwas the Prince of life, they would not have crucified Him. Why did\n\nthey not know? Because they refused every evidence given them\n\nthat Christ was the Messiah.... They will look upon the believers\n\nas a little, weak people, a few fanatics, and will speak derisively of\n\nthem.—Letter 35 a, 1877."

Hebrews 11:36.\n\nWhen Jesus revealed to His disciples the fate of Jerusalem and\n\nthe scenes of the Second Advent, He foretold also the experience\n\nof His people from the time when He should be taken from them to\n\nHis return in power and glory for their deliverance. From Olivet the\n\nSaviour beheld the storms about to fall upon the apostolic church,\n\nand, penetrating deeper into the future, His eye discerned the fierce,\n\nwasting tempests that were to beat upon His followers in the coming\n\nages of darkness and persecution....\n\nThe history of the early church testified to the fulfillment of the\n\nSaviour’s words. The powers of earth and hell arrayed themselves\n\nagainst Christ in the person of His followers.... Christians were\n\nstripped of their possessions and driven from their homes.... Great\n\nnumbers sealed their testimony with their blood....\n\nUnder the fiercest persecution these witnesses for Jesus kept\n\ntheir faith unsullied.... With words of faith, patience, and hope they\n\nencouraged one another to endure privation and distress. The loss\n\nof every earthly blessing could not force them to renounce their\n\nbelief in Christ. Trials and persecutions were but steps bringing\n\nthem nearer their rest and their reward....\n\nIn vain were Satan’s efforts to destroy the church of Christ by vi-\n\nolence. The great controversy in which the disciples of Jesus yielded\n\nup their lives did not cease when these faithful standard-bearers fell\n\nat their post. By defeat they conquered. God’s workmen were slain,\n\nbut His work went steadily forward. The gospel continued to spread,\n\nand the number of its adherents to increase.... Said a Christian, ex-\n\npostulating with the heathen rulers who were urging forward the\n\npersecution: “You may torment, afflict, and vex us. Your wickedness\n\nputs our weakness to the test, but your cruelty is of no avail. It is but\n\na stronger invitation to bring others to our persuasion. The more we\n\n664\n\nPersecutionInEarlyCenturies,November 8 665\n\nare mowed down, the more we spring up again. The blood of the\n\nChristians is seed.”\n\nThousands were imprisoned and slain; but others sprang up to\n\nfill their places. And those who were martyred for their faith were\n\nsecured to Christ, and accounted of Him as conquerors. They had\n\nfought the good fight, and they were to receive the crown of glory\n\nwhen Christ should come.

Persecution ceased, and in its stead\n\nwere substituted the dangerous allurements of temporal prosperity\n\nand worldly honor. Idolaters were led to receive a part of the Chris-\n\ntian faith, while they rejected other essential truths. They professed\n\nto accept Jesus as the Son of God, and to believe in His death and\n\nresurrection; but they had no conviction of sin, and felt no need of\n\nrepentance or of a change of heart. With some concessions on their\n\npart, they proposed that Christians should make concessions, that all\n\nmight unite on the platform of belief in Christ.\n\nNow was the church in fearful peril.

Under a\n\ncloak of pretended Christianity Satan was insinuating himself into\n\nthe church, to corrupt their faith and turn their minds from the word\n\nof truth.\n\nAt last the larger portion of the Christian company lowered their\n\nstandard, and a union was formed between Christianity and pagan-\n\nism.

The foul leaven of idolatry, thus introduced into\n\nthe church, continued its baleful work. Unsound doctrines, super-\n\nstitious rites, and idolatrous ceremonies were incorporated into her\n\nfaith and worship.

And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.\n\nMatthew 25:1, 2.\n\nThere have ever been two classes among those who profess to\n\nbe followers of Christ. While one class study the Saviour’s life and\n\nearnestly seek to correct their defects and conform to the Pattern, the\n\nother class shun the plain, practical truths that expose their errors.\n\nEven in her best estate the church was not composed wholly of the\n\ntrue, pure, and sincere. Our Saviour taught that those who willfully\n\nindulgeinsinarenottobereceivedintothechurch; yetHeconnected\n\nwith Himself men who were faulty in character, and granted them\n\nthe benefits of His teachings and example, that they might have an\n\nopportunity to see and correct their errors.\n\nAmong the twelve apostles was a traitor. Judas was accepted,\n\nnot because of his defects of character, but notwithstanding them.\n\nHe was connected with the disciples that through the instruction\n\nand example of Christ he might learn what constitutes Christian\n\ncharacter, and thus be led to see his errors, to repent, and, by the aid\n\nof divine grace, to purify his soul “in obeying the truth.”\n\nBut Judas did not walk in the light so graciously permitted to\n\nshine upon him. By indulgence in sin he invited the temptations of\n\nSatan. His evil traits of character became predominant. He yielded\n\nhis mind to the control of the powers of darkness, he became angry\n\nwhen his faults were reproved, and thus he was led to commit the\n\nfearful crime of betraying his Master. In like manner do all who\n\ncherish evil under a profession of godliness hate those who disturb\n\ntheir peace by condemning their course of sin. When a favorable\n\nopportunity is presented, they will, like Judas, betray those who for\n\ntheir good have sought to reprove them.\n\n668\n\nThereAreTwoClassesAmongChrist’sFollowers,November 10 669\n\nThe apostles encountered those in the church who professed\n\ngodliness while they were secretly cherishing iniquity. Ananias and\n\nSapphira acted the part of deceivers, pretending to make an entire\n\nsacrifice for God, when they were covetously withholding a portion\n\nfor themselves.... As trials and persecution came upon His [Christ’s]\n\nfollowers, those only who were willing to forsake all for the truth’s\n\nsake desired to become His disciples. Thus, as long as persecution\n\ncontinued, the churchremainedcomparatively pure.

It is a lamp to our feet, a\n\nlight to our path. It flashes its light ahead, that we may see the path\n\nby which we are traveling; and its rays are thrown back on past\n\nhistory, showing the most perfect harmony in that which to the mind\n\nin darkness appears like error and discord. In that which seems to\n\nthe worldling an inexplicable mystery, God’s children see light and\n\nbeauty....\n\nThe Israelites placed over their doors a signature of blood, to\n\nshow that they were God’s property. So every child of God in this\n\nage will bear the signature God has appointed.... God declares, “I\n\ngave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that\n\nthey might know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify them.” When\n\npeople say that the law of God is abrogated by the testimonies of\n\n“the fathers,” they are teaching for doctrine the commandments of\n\nmen....\n\nWe are living in a momentous period in this earth’s history.\n\nThe great conflict is just before us.... The man of sin has worked\n\nwith a marvelous perseverance to exalt a spurious sabbath, and the\n\ndisloyal Protestant world has wondered after the beast and has called\n\nobedience to the Sabbath instituted by Jehovah disloyalty to the\n\nlaws of the nations. Kingdoms have confederated to sustain a false\n\nsabbath institution, which has not a word of authority in the oracles\n\nof God....\n\nThe great conflict now being waged is not merely a strife of\n\nhumans against humans. On the one side stands the Prince of Life,\n\nacting as our substitute and surety; on the other [stands] the prince\n\nof darkness, with the fallen angels under his command.... “Put on\n\n682\n\nGodCallsUsToBeChildrenoftheLight,November 17 683\n\nthe whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the\n\nwiles of the devil.”\n\nThere will be a sharp conflict between those who are loyal to\n\nGod and those who cast scorn upon His law. The church has joined\n\nhands with the world. Reverence to God’s law has been subverted.\n\nThe religious leaders have taught for doctrine the commandments\n\nof men. As it was in the days of Noah, so it is in this age of the\n\nworld.... The truly loyal will not be carried away by the current of\n\nevil. They will not throw scorn and contempt on that which God\n\nhas set apart as holy. The test comes to everyone. There are only\n\ntwo sides. Which are you on?—Manuscript 39, 1899 (see also The\n\nReview and Herald, February 6, 1900)."

Daniel was a prince of Judah.\n\nIsaiah also was of the royal tribe. David was a shepherd boy, Amos\n\na herdsman, Zechariah a captive from Babylon, Elisha a tiller of\n\nthe soil.

The angel\n\nof Revelation 10 is represented as having one foot on the sea and one\n\nfoot on the land, showing that the message will be carried to distant\n\nlands, the ocean will be crossed, and the islands of the sea will hear\n\nthe proclamation of the last message of warning to our world....\n\n“That there should be time no longer.” This message announces\n\nthe end of the prophetic periods. The disappointment of those who\n\nexpected to see our Lord in 1844 was indeed bitter to those who had\n\nso ardently looked for His appearing. It was in the Lord’s order that\n\nthis disappointment should come, and that hearts should be revealed.\n\nNot one cloud has fallen upon the church that God has not pre-\n\npared for; not one opposing force has risen to counterwork the work\n\nof God that He has not foreseen. All has taken place as He has\n\npredicted through His prophets. He has not left His church forsaken\n\nin darkness, but has traced in prophetic declarations what would\n\noccur, and through His providence, acting in its appointed place\n\nin the world’s history, He has brought about that which His Holy\n\nSpirit inspired the prophets to foretell. All His purposes will be\n\nfulfilled and established. His law is linked with His throne, and\n\nsatanic agencies combined with human agencies cannot destroy it.\n\nTruth is inspired and guarded by God; it will live, and will suc-\n\nceed, although it may appear at times to be overshadowed. The\n\ngospel of Christ is the law exemplified in character. The deceptions\n\npracticed against it, every device for vindicating falsehood, every\n\nerror forged by satanic agencies, will eventually be eternally broken,\n\nand the triumph of truth will be like the appearing of the sun at\n\n706\n\nAngelofRevelation 10 ProclaimsGod’sLastMessage,November 29 707\n\nnoonday.

John stands in his place.\n\nIn the Revelation the Lion of the tribe of Judah has opened to the\n\nstudents of prophecy the book of Daniel, and thus is Daniel standing\n\nin his place.

By his faithful service\n\nhe taught those in Babylon that his God was a living God, not an\n\nimage such as they worshiped. It was God’s design to show the\n\nBabylonians that there was a King above the king of Babylon—the\n\nGod whom the Hebrew youth worshiped. These youth exalted God.\n\nThey knew that they were to carry out the principles of truth, and\n\ntherefore they refused the meat from the royal table and the wine\n\nfrom the royal cellar. Their abstinence from the prescribed bill of\n\nfare made a distinction in every way between their appearance and\n\nthe appearance of those youth who indulged their appetite.\n\nThere were plentyto make remarks, butthese youthwere faithful\n\neven in little things. And in physical appearance they were far ahead\n\nof the youth who sat at the king’s table. Their simple diet kept their\n\nminds clear. They were better prepared for their studies, for they\n\nnever knew the oppression caused by eating luxurious food. They\n\nwere better prepared physically for taxing labor, for they were never\n\nsick. With clear minds they could think and work vigorously. By\n\nobeying God, they were doing the very things that will give strength\n\nof thought and memory. God ordained Daniel and his fellows to\n\nbe connected with the great men of Babylon, that these men might\n\nbecome acquainted with the religion of the Hebrews, and know that\n\nGod reigns over all kingdoms....\n\nIn like manner the Lord means that Seventh-day Adventists shall\n\nwitness for Him. They are not to be hidden away from the world.\n\nThey are to be in the world, but not of the world. They are to stand\n\ndistinct from the world in their manner of dealing.

Romans 8:18.\n\nNo one would think of entering an army in time of war, hoping\n\nto have ease and self-indulgence and a real pleasant and profitable\n\ntime. They know that hardships and privations are the liabilities; and\n\nas long as the war lasts, they will have coarse food and often short\n\nrations, long weary marches by day, enduring the heat of the burning\n\nsun, camping out at night in the open air, exposed to drenching rains\n\nand chilling frosts, venturing health and life itself as they stand as\n\ntargets for the enemy.\n\nThe Christian life is compared to the life of a soldier, and there\n\ncan be no bribes presented of ease and self-indulgence. The idea that\n\nChristian soldiers are to be excused from the conflicts, experiencing\n\nnotrials, havingalltemporalcomfortstoenjoy, andeventheluxuries\n\nof life, is a farce.

Ezekiel 20:19, 20.\n\nThe Sabbath was given to all humankind to commemorate the\n\nwork of creation. The great Jehovah, when He had laid the foun-\n\ndations of the earth, when He had dressed the whole world in its\n\ngarb of beauty, and created all the wonders of the land and the sea,\n\ninstituted the Sabbath day and made it holy.... God sanctified and\n\nblessed the day in which He had rested from all His wondrous work.\n\nAnd this Sabbath, sanctified of God, was to be kept for a perpetual\n\ncovenant. It was a memorial that was to stand from age to age, till\n\nthe close of earth’s history....\n\nDuring their stay in Egypt, Israel had so long heard and seen\n\nidolatry practiced that to a large degree they had lost their knowl-\n\nedge of God and of His law, and their sense of the importance and\n\nsacredness of the Sabbath. The law was given a second time to call\n\nthese things to their remembrance. In God’s statutes was defined\n\npractical religion for all humankind....\n\nThere are those who hold that the Sabbath was given only for\n\nthe Jews; but God has never said this. He committed the Sabbath to\n\nHis people Israel as a sacred trust, but the very fact that the desert\n\nof Sinai, and not Palestine, was the place selected by Him in which\n\nto proclaim His law reveals that He intended it for all humankind.\n\nThe law of Ten Commandments is as old as creation. Therefore the\n\nSabbath institution has no special relation to the Jews, any more\n\nthan to all other created beings. God has made the observance of\n\nthe Sabbath obligatory upon all people. “The Sabbath,” it is plainly\n\nstated, “was made for man.” Let everyone, therefore, who is in\n\ndanger of being deceived on this point give heed to the Word of God\n\nrather than the assertions of humans....\n\n738\n\nSealOfGodIsTheSabbath,December 14 739\n\nEvery person has been placed on trial, as were Adam and Eve\n\nin Eden.

In regard to the fruit of the tree of knowledge, the\n\nrestriction was made, Ye shall not eat of it ... lest ye die. Of the\n\nSabbath, God said, Ye shall not defile it, but keep it holy.... As the\n\ntree of knowledge was the test of Adam’s obedience, so the fourth\n\ncommand is the test that God has given to prove the loyalty of all\n\nHis people. The experience of Adam is to be a warning to us so long\n\nas time shall last.

Esther 3:13.\n\nSatan willexcite the indignation ofapostate Christendom against\n\nthe humble remnant who conscientiously refuse to accept false cus-\n\ntoms and traditions.... The church and the world will unite, and the\n\nworld will lend to the church power to crush out the right of the\n\npeople to worship according to His Word.\n\nThedecreethatistogoforthagainstthepeopleofGodinthenear\n\nfuture is in some respects similar to that issued by Ahasuerus against\n\nthe Jews in the time of Esther. The Persian edict sprang from the\n\nmaliceofHamantowardMordecai.... Theking’sdecisionagainstthe\n\nJews was secured under false pretenses, through a misrepresentation\n\nof that peculiar people. Satan instigated this scheme in order to rid\n\nthe earth of those who preserved the knowledge of the true God....\n\nHistory repeats itself. The same masterful mind that plotted\n\nagainst the faithful in ages past is now at work to gain control of\n\nthe fallen churches, that through them he may condemn and put to\n\ndeath all who will not worship the idol sabbath. We have not to\n\nbattle with mortals, as it may appear. We war not against flesh and\n\nblood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers\n\nof the darkness of this world, against wicked spirits in high places.\n\nBut if the people of God will put their trust in Him and by faith rely\n\nupon His power, the devices of Satan will be defeated in our time as\n\nsignally as in the days of Mordecai.\n\nThe decree is to go forth that all who will not receive the mark\n\nof the beast shall neither buy nor sell and, finally, that they shall be\n\nput to death. But the saints of God do not receive this mark. The\n\nprophet of Patmos beheld those who had gotten the victory over the\n\nbeast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of\n\n760\n\nDeathDecreeAgainstGod’sPeople,December 25 761\n\nhis name, standing on the sea of glass, having the harps of God and\n\nsinging the song of Moses and the Lamb....\n\nPaul writes to the Romans, “If it be possible, as much as lieth\n\nin you, live peaceably with all men.” But there is a point beyond\n\nwhich it is impossible to maintain union and harmony without the\n\nsacrifice of principle. Separation then becomes an absolute duty.\n\nThe laws of nations should be respected when they do not conflict\n\nwith the laws of God. But when there is collision between them,\n\nevery true disciple of Christ will say, as did the apostle Peter when\n\ncommanded to speak no more in the name of Jesus, “We ought to\n\nobey God rather than men.”—Manuscript 51, 1899 (see also The\n\nSigns of the Times, November 8, 1899).\n\nAll Revelation In Scripture Comes From Jesus"

    "content": "No prophecy of scripture is a matter of one’s own\n\ninterpretation, because no prophecy ever came by human will,\n\nbut men and women moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from\n\nGod. 2 Peter 1:20, 21, NRSV.\n\nThe whole Bible is a revelation, for all revelation to human\n\nbeings comes through Christ and all centers in Him. God has spoken\n\nunto us by His Son, whose we are by creation and by redemption.\n\nChrist came to John, exiled on the isle of Patmos, to give him the\n\ntruth for these last days, to show him that which must shortly come\n\nto pass. Jesus Christ is the great trustee of divine revelation. It is\n\nthrough Him that we have a knowledge of what we are to look for\n\nin the closing scenes of this earth’s history....\n\nJohn, the beloved disciple, was the one chosen to receive this\n\nrevelation. He was the last survivor of the first chosen disciples. Un-\n\nder the New Testament dispensation he was honored as the prophet\n\nDaniel was honored under the Old Testament dispensation.\n\nThe instruction to be communicated to John was so important\n\nthat Christ came from heaven to give it to His servant, telling him\n\nto send it to the churches. This instruction is to be the object of our\n\ncareful and prayerful study, for we are living in a time when persons\n\nwho are not under the teaching of the Holy Spirit will bring in false\n\ntheories....\n\nAfterthepassingofthetime, GodentrustedtoHisfaithful\n\nfollowers the precious principles of present truth.... Those who\n\npassed through these experiences are to be as firm as a rock to the\n\nprinciples that have made us Seventh-day Adventists.... Those who\n\ntook part in the establishment of our work upon a foundation of\n\nBible truth, those who know the way marks that have pointed out the\n\nright path, are to be regarded as workers of the highest value. They\n\ncan speak from personal experience regarding the truths entrusted\n\n762\n\nAllRevelationInScriptureComesFromJesusChrist,December 26 763\n\nto them. These workers are not to permit their faith to be changed\n\nto infidelity; they are not to permit the banner of the third angel to\n\nbe taken from their hands. They are to hold the beginning of their\n\nconfidence firm unto the end.\n\nThe Lord has declared that the history of the past shall be re-\n\nhearsed as we enter upon the closing work. Every truth that He has\n\ngiven for these last days is to be proclaimed to the world. Every\n\npillar that He has established is to be strengthened. We cannot now\n\nstep off the foundation that God has established. We cannot now\n\nenter into any new organization, for this would mean apostasy from\n\nthe truth.—Manuscript 129, 1905."

Isaiah 26:7.\n\nWe have before us in the Word of God instances of heavenly\n\nagencies working on the minds of kings and rulers, while at the\n\nsame time satanic agencies were also at work on their minds. No\n\nhuman eloquence, in strongly set forth human opinions, can change\n\nthe working of satanic agencies. Satan seeks continually to block\n\nthe way, so that the truth shall be bound about by human devising,\n\nand those who have light and knowledge are in the greatest danger\n\nunless they constantly consecrate themselves to God, humiliating\n\nself, and realizing the peril of the times.\n\nHeavenly beings are appointed to answer the prayers of those\n\nwho are working unselfishly for the interests of the cause of God.\n\nThe very highest angels in the heavenly courts are appointed to work\n\nout the prayers that ascend to God for the advancement of the cause\n\nof God.

I call upon the ministers\n\nof Christ to press home upon the understanding of all who come\n\nwithin the reach of their voice the truth of the ministration of angels.\n\nDo not indulge in fanciful speculations. The written Word is our\n\nonly safety. We must pray as did Daniel, that we may be guarded by\n\nheavenly intelligences. As ministering spirits, angels are sent forth\n\nto minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation. Pray ... pray as\n\nyou have never prayed before. We are not prepared for the Lord’s\n\ncoming.

When\n\ndifficulties arise in any branch of the cause—as they surely will,\n\nfor the church militant is not the church triumphant—all heaven is\n\nwatching to see what will be the course of those who are entrusted\n\nwith sacred responsibilities. Some will stumble, some will give\n\nheed to seducing spirits; some will choose darkness rather than light\n\nbecause they are not true to God. Like their Master, those who are\n\nabiding in Christ will not fall nor be discouraged....\n\nNow when we are just on the borders of the Promised Land,\n\nlet none repeat the sin of the unfaithful spies.

All the difficulties were magnified\n\ninto insurmountable obstacles. They made it appear as folly and\n\npresumption to think of going up to possess the land.... But Caleb\n\nstilled them before Moses, and said, “Let us go up at once, and\n\npossess it; for we are well able to overcome it.”\n\nThis was the language of faith; but the spies who had spoken\n\ndiscouragingly were not to be baffled in their attempts to prevent the\n\npeople from going forward in doing the word of the Lord.... They\n\nexaggerated the difficulties until all the congregation was crazed\n\nwith discouragement and fear....\n\nAmid all the lamentations and bitterness of feeling, Caleb and\n\nJoshua spoke to the congregation, “The land, which we passed\n\n768\n\nWeAreOnTheBordersOfThePromisedLand,December 29 769\n\nthrough to search it, is an exceeding good land.” But the people\n\nwished to believe the worst, and while the ringing voice of Caleb\n\nwas heard above the tumult, they stood with stones in their hands to\n\nbatter down the men who bore the right testimony....\n\nWhile the people were cherishing doubts, and believing the\n\nunfaithful spies, the golden opportunity for Israel passed by....
