The manner in which we spend each passing day\nwill decide this question....\nLet us enter upon the new year with our hearts cleansed from\nthe defilement of selfishness and pride. Let us put away every sinful\nindulgence, and seek to become faithful, diligent learners in the\nschool of Christ.

Ever bear in mind that your acts\nare daily passing into history by the pen of the recording angel. You\nmust meet them again when the Judgment shall sit and the books\nshall be opened....\nIf we connect with God, the source of peace, and light, and truth,\nHis Spirit will flow through us as a channel, to refresh and bless all\naround us. This may be the last year of life to us. Shall we not enter\nupon it with thoughtful consideration? Shall not sincerity, respect,\nbenevolence, mark our deportment toward all?\nLet us withhold nothing from Him who gave His precious life\nfor us.... Let us all consecrate to God the property He has entrusted\nto us. Above all, let us give Him ourselves, a freewill offering.\nMay the beginning of this year be a time that shall never be\nforgotten—a time when Christ shall come in among us, and say,\n“Peace be unto you.” John 20:19. Brethren and sisters, I wish you,\none and all, a happy new year.\n“We live in deeds, not years;\nIn thoughts, not breaths;\nHappyNewYear!

Matthew\n7:13, 14.\nBefore you are two ways—the broad road of self-indulgence\nand the narrow path of self-sacrifice. Into the broad road you can\ntake selfishness, pride, love of the world; but those who walk in the\nnarrow way must lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so\neasily beset.

Only\nthose who are abiding in Christ can know what true life is. They\nrealize the value of true religion.

Many of them suffer a lingering sick-\nness, yet have no strong and mighty One to lean upon, no strength-\nening grace from a higher power to support them in their weakness.\nThey lean upon their own strength. They obtain no consolation by\nlooking forward to the future, but a fearful uncertainty torments\nthem; and thus they close their eyes in death, not finding any plea-\nsure in looking forward to the resurrection morn, for they have no\ncheering hope that they shall have part in the first resurrection....\nThe Christian is subject to sickness, disappointment, poverty,\nreproach, and distress. Yet amid all this he loves God, he chooses\nto do His will, and prizes nothing so highly as His approbation. In\nthe conflicting trials and changing scenes of this life, he knows that\nthere is One who knows it all, One who will bend His ear low to the\ncry of the sorrowful and distressed, One who can sympathize with\nevery sorrow and soothe the keen anguish of every heart....\nAmid all his affliction, the Christian has strong consolation.

It is the only true guide in all matters of faith and practice.\nThe reason why Satan has so great control over the minds and hearts\nof men is that they have not made the Word of God the man of their\ncounsel, and all their ways have not been tried by the true test. The\nBible will show us what course we must pursue to become heirs of\nglory.\nAs the heart is opened to the entrance of the Word, light from\nthe throne of God will shine into the soul. That Word, cherished\n66 OurHighCalling\nin the heart, will yield to the student a treasure of knowledge that\nis priceless. Its ennobling principles will stamp the character with\nhonesty and truthfulness, temperance and integrity."

Let no one say that\nthe truth you profess makes you no different from the worldling....\nDo not give the least occasion for anyone to speak ill of your faith\nbecause you are not sanctified through the truth.\nWhen the truth as it is in Jesus molds our characters, it will be\nseen to be truth indeed. As it is contemplated by the true believer, it\nwill grow brighter, shining in its original beauty. As we behold it,\nit will increase in value, brightening in its own natural loveliness,\nquickening and vivifying the mind, and subduing our selfish, un-\n68 OurHighCalling\nChristlike coarseness of character.

And every man that striveth for the mastery is\ntemperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown;\nbut we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so\nfight I, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and\nbring it into subjection.” 1 Corinthians 9:24-27.\nAthletes cheerfully comply with the conditions in order to be\ntrained for the highest taxation of their physical strength. They do\nnot indulge appetite, but put a constant restraint upon themselves,\nrefraining from food which would weaken or lessen the full power\nof any of their organs. Yet they fight “as one that beateth the air,”\nwhile Christians are in a real contest. Combatants in the games seek\nfor mere perishable laurels. Christians have before them a glorious\ncrown of immortality, incorruptible. And in this heavenly race there\nis plenty of room for all to obtain the prize. Not one will fail if he\nruns well, if he does according to the light which shines upon him,\nexercising his abilities which, to the best of his knowledge, he has\nkept in a healthful condition....\nAny habit or practice which will weaken the nerve and brain\npower or the physical strength disqualifies for the exercise of the\nnext grace which comes in after temperance—patience....\nA man who is intemperate, who uses stimulating indulgences—\nbeer, wine, strong drinks, tea and coffee, opium, tobacco, or any of\nthese substances that are deleterious to health—cannot be a patient\nman. So temperance is a round of the ladder upon which we must\nplant our feet before we can add the grace of patience. In food, in\nraiment, in work, in regular hours, in healthful exercise, we must be\nregulated by the knowledge which it is our duty to obtain that we\n“AndtoKnowledgeTemperance”,March4 141\nmay, through earnest endeavor, place ourselves in right relation to\nlife and health."

Now unless godliness was\nadded to patience man would not show that brotherly kindness. In\nHis mission to our world, Christ has shown man the graces of the\nSpirit of God which, when accepted, fashion and mold the entire\nman, externally as well as internally, by abasing his pride and lead-\ning him not to esteem himself highly but to esteem his brother as\nprecious in the sight of God because Christ paid an infinite price for\nhis soul. When man is valued as God’s property then we will be\nkind, amiable, and condescending toward him.\nThe religion of Jesus Christ is a system of the true heavenly\npoliteness and leads to a practical exhibition of habitual tenderness\nof feeling, kindness of deportment.

Hebrews\n3:13.\nMark the words “deceitfulness of sin.” Satan always presents\nhis temptations under the guise of goodness. Beware that you yield\nnot to them. One violation of straightforward truthfulness prepares\nthe way for the second violation, and wrongs are repeated, until the\nheart of unbelief becomes hardened, and the conscience loses its\nsensitiveness.\nLet none flatter themselves that the sins of their youth can easily\nbe given up by and by. This is not so. Every sin cherished weakens\nthe character and strengthens the habit; and physical, mental, and\nmoral depravity result. You may repent of the wrong you have\ndone, and set your feet in right paths; but the mold of your mind and\nyour familiarity with evil will make it difficult for you to distinguish\nbetween right and wrong. Through the wrong habits you have\nformed Satan will assail you again and again.\nMany ... look upon sin as a little thing.... Many take counsel\nof their own wishes and desires and follow their inclinations and\nfinally conclude that sin is not so very offensive, not so terrible and\ndreadful in the sight of God. Sin that may appear little, that may\nbe termed little by the blunted conscience, is so grievous a thing in\nthe sight of God that nothing but the blood of God’s own Son could\nwash it away. This fact places the true estimate upon sin. God will\nnever tarnish His glory to come to our ideas and views. We shall\ncertainly have to come to His. Just in proportion to the excellence\nof God is the heinous character of sin....\nGod seeks our real happiness. If anything lies in the way of this,\nHe sees it must first be removed.

Satan\ncomes to us with worldly honor, wealth, and the pleasures of life.\nThese temptations are varied to meet men of every rank and degree,\ntempting them away from God to serve themselves more than their\nCreator. “All these things will I give thee,” said Satan to Christ. “All\nthese things will I give thee,” says Satan to man. “All this money,\nthis land, all this power, and honor, and riches, will I give thee”; and\nman is charmed, deceived, and treacherously allured on to his ruin.\nIf we give ourselves up to worldliness of heart and of life, Satan is\nsatisfied.\nThe Saviour overcame the wily foe, showing us how we may\novercome. He has left us His example, to repel Satan with Scripture.\nHe might have had recourse to His own divine power, ... but His\nexample would not then have been as useful to us. Christ used only\n188 OurHighCalling\nScripture. How important that the Word of God be thoroughly stud-\nied and followed, that in case of emergency we may be “throughly\nfurnished unto all good works” and especially fortified to meet the\nwily foe."

Any willful violation of the righteous law\nof Jehovah exposes your soul to the full assaults of Satan.\nWhen you lose your conscious integrity, your soul becomes a\nbattlefield for Satan; you have doubts and fears enough to paralyze\nyour energies and drive you to discouragement....\nRemember that temptation is not sin.

        "content": "There are those who recklessly place themselves in scenes of\ndangerandperil, andexpose themselves to temptations, outofwhich\nit would require a miracle of God to bring them unharmed and\nuntainted. These are presumptuous acts, with which God is not\npleased. Satan’s temptation to the Saviour of the world to cast\nHimselffrom the pinnacle ofthe temple, was firmlymetandresisted.\nThe archenemy quoted a promise of God as security, that Christ\nmight with safety do this on the strength of the promise. Jesus met\nthis temptation with Scripture: “It is written, Thou shalt not tempt\nthe Lord thy God.” In the same way Satan urges men into places\nwhere God does not require them to go, presenting Scripture to\njustify his suggestions.\nThe precious promises of God are not given to strengthen man\nin a presumptuous course, or for him to rely upon when he rushes\nneedlessly into danger.... We are required, as children of God, to\nmaintain the consistency of our Christian character. We should\nexercise prudence, caution, and humility, and walk circumspectly\ntoward them that are without. Yet we are not in any case to surrender\nprinciple.\nOur only safety is in giving no place to the devil; for his sugges-\ntions and purposes are ever to injure us, and hinder us from relying\nupon God. He transforms himself into an angel of purity, that he\nmay, through his specious temptations, introduce his devices in such\na manner that we may not discern his wiles. The more we yield,\nthe more powerful will be his deceptions over us. It is unsafe to\ncontrovert or to parley with him. For every advantage we give the\nenemy, he will claim more. Our only safety is to reject firmly the\nfirst insinuation to presumption. God has given us grace through\nthe merits of Christ sufficient to withstand Satan, and be more than\n192 OurHighCalling\nconquerors. Resistance is success. “Resist the devil, and he will flee\nfrom you.” Resistance must be firm and steadfast. We lose all we\ngain if we resist today only to yield tomorrow."

There\nis nothing so hard as the crucifixion of the will. Christ was tempted\nin all points like as we are; but His will was ever kept on the side of\nGod’s will. In His humanity He had the same free will that Adam\nhad in Eden. He could have yielded to temptation as Adam yielded.\nAnd Adam, by believing God and being a doer of His word, could\nhave resisted temptation as Christ resisted it.

But at every point He met the tempter with,\n“It is written.” His will was in perfect obedience to the will of God,\nand the will of God was revealed throughout His entire life....\nChrist’s obedience to His Father’s commandments is to be the\nmeasure of our obedience. Those who follow Christ, if they would\nbecome complete in Him, must keep their will surrendered to the\nwill of God. Abundant provision has been made that those who will\nseek God with the whole heart may find Him a present help in every\nInUnisonwithGod,April11 217\ntime of trouble.

Man has nothing\nin himself. The most exalted talent does not originate from man,\nbut is the endowment of his Creator, and can purchase nothing from\nGod.

Let no one think\nthat costly offerings to benevolent enterprises will elevate him in the\nsight of God, or purchase for him the favor of Heaven, or procure\nfor him a place in the mansions which Jesus has gone to prepare\nfor those who love Him. The precious blood of Christ is wholly\nefficacious....\nThe resurrection of Christ from the dead was the Father’s seal\nto the mission of Christ. It was a public expression of His entire\nsatisfaction in the atoning work. He accepted the sacrifice that Jesus\nhad made on our behalf. It was everything that God required, perfect\nand complete. No human being by any work of his own could piece\nout the work of Christ. When on the cross Jesus uttered the cry,\n“It is finished!” glory and joy thrilled heaven, and discomfiture fell\nupon the confederacy of evil. After that triumphant cry, the world’s\nRedeemer bowed His head and died,... but by His death He was a\nconqueror, and He has opened the gates of eternal glory so that all\nwho believe in Him may not perish, but have everlasting life.\nThe sinner’s only hope is to rely wholly upon Jesus Christ....\nOur acceptance with God is sure only through His beloved Son, and\ngood works are but the result of the working of His sin-pardoning\nlove.

        "content": "Many pass long years in darkness and doubt because they do not\nfeel as they desire. But feeling has nothing to do with faith. That\nfaith which works by love and purifies the soul is not a matter of\nimpulse. It ventures out upon the promises of God, firmly believing\nthat what He has said, He is able also to perform. Our souls may\nbe trained to believe, taught to rely upon the Word of God. That\nWord declares that “the just shall live by faith” (Romans 1:17), not\nby feeling.\nLet us put away everything like distrust and want of faith in\nJesus. Let us commence a life of simple, childlike trust, not relying\nupon feeling, but upon faith. Do not dishonor Jesus by doubting His\nprecious promises. He wants us to believe in Him with unwavering\nfaith.\nThere is a class who say, “I believe, I believe,” and lay claim to\nall the promises which are given on condition of obedience; but they\ndo not the works of Christ. God is not honored by any such faith. It\nis spurious. Another class are trying to keep all the commandments\nof God, but many of them do not come up to their exalted privilege\nin claiming the promises that were given for them. God’s promises\nare for those who keep His commandments, and do those things that\nare pleasing in His sight.\nI find that I have to fight the good fight of faith every day. I have\nto exercise all my faith, and not rely upon feeling; I have to act as\nthough I knew the Lord heard me, and would answer me and bless\nme. Faith is not a happy flight of feeling; it is simply taking God at\nHis word—believing that He will fulfill His promises because He\nsaid He would.\nHope in God, trust in Him, and rest in His promises, whether\nyou feel happy or not. A good emotion is no evidence that you are\na child of God, neither are disturbed, troubled, perplexing feelings\nFeelingNotaSafeGuide,April23 241\nan evidence that you are not a child of God. Come to the Scriptures\nand intelligently take God at His word. Comply with the conditions\nand believe He will accept you as His child. Be not faithless, but\nbelieving."

If we would give more expression\nto our faith, rejoice more in the blessings that we know we have, we\nwould daily have great cheerfulness and strength.\nFeeling and faith are as distinct from each other as the east is\nfrom the west. Faith is not dependent on feeling. Daily we should\ndedicate ourselves to God, and believe that Christ understands and\naccepts the sacrifice, without examining ourselves to see if we have\nthat degree of feeling that we think should correspond with our faith.\nHave we not the assurance that our heavenly Father is more willing\nto give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him in faith than parents are\nto give good gifts to their children? We should go forward as if to\nevery prayerthat we send to the throne of God we heard the response\nfrom the One whose promises never fail.

The Lord is not pleased to have us fret and worry ourselves\nout of the arms of Jesus. He is the only source of every grace, the\nfulfillment of every promise, the realization of every blessing....

A set form of words is\nused, but there is no real importunity. These prayers are doubtful,\nhesitating; they bring no relief to those who offer them, and no\ncomfort or hope to others. The form of prayer is used, but the spirit\nis wanting, showing that the petitioner does not feel his need....\nLearn to pray short and right to the point, asking for just what\nyou need. Learn to pray aloud where only God can hear you. Do not\noffer make-believe prayers, but earnest, feeling petitions, expressing\nthe hunger of the soul for the Bread of Life. If we prayed more in\nsecret, we should be able to pray more intelligently in public. These\ndoubtful, hesitating prayers would cease. And when we engaged\nwith our brethren in public worship, we could add to the interest of\nthe meeting; for we should bring with us some of the atmosphere of\nheaven, and our worship would be a reality, and not a mere form....If\nthe soul is not drawn out in prayer in the closet and while engaged in\nthe business of the day, it will be manifest in the prayer meeting....\nThe life of the soul depends upon habitual communion with God.\nIts wants are made known, and the heart is open to receive fresh\nblessings. Gratitude flows from unfeigned lips; and the refreshing\nthat is received from Jesus is manifested in words, in deeds of active\nbenevolence, and in public devotion. There is love to Jesus in the\nheart; and where love exists, it will not be repressed, but will express\nitself. Secret prayer sustains this inner life. The heart that loves God\nwill desire to commune with Him, and will lean on Him in holy\nconfidence.\nLet us learn to pray intelligently, expressing our requests with\nclearness and precision. Let us ... pray as though we meant it. “The\nLearnHowtoPray,May4 265\neffectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.” James\n5:16."

The Lord Jesus knows that it is not possible for\nus to resist the many temptations of Satan, only as we shall have\ndivine power given us from God.

Put your whole being\ninto the Lord’s hands, soul, body, and spirit, and resolve to be His\nloving, consecrated agency, moved by His will, controlled by His\nmind, infused by His Spirit.\nTell Jesus your wants in the sincerity of your soul. You are not\nrequired to hold a long controversy with, or preach a sermon to,\nGod, but with a heart of sorrow for your sins, say, “Save me, Lord,\nor I perish.” There is hope for such souls.

If\ncompelled to be in the society of those who are evil, you are not\ncompelled to enter into or engage in their evil. You can, by prayer\nand watching, remain unsullied by the evil manifested about you.\n“Watch and pray” is an injunction often repeated in the Scrip-\ntures. In the lives of those who obey this injunction there will be\nan undercurrent of happiness that will bless all with whom they are\nbrought in contact. Those who are sour and cross in disposition will\nbecome sweet and gentle; those who are proud will become meek\nand lowly.\nA man cannot be a happy Christian unless he is a watchful\nChristian.

Man’s will, unless\nVictoryThroughWatchfulness,May6 269\nkept in subjection to the will of God, is as often on the enemy’s side\nas on the Lord’s side.

And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit. James 5:17, 18. Important lessons are presented to us in the experience of Elijah. When upon Mount Carmel he offered the prayer for rain, his faith was tested, but he persevered in making known his request unto God. The servant watched while Elijah prayed. Six times he returned from the watch, saying, There is nothing, no cloud, no sign of rain. But the prophet did not give up in discouragement. He kept reviewing his life, to see where he had failed to honor God.... As he searched his heart, he seemed to be less and less, both in his own estimation and in the sight of God. It seemed to him that he was nothing, and that God was everything; and when he reached the point of renouncing self, while he clung to the Saviour as his only strength and righteousness, the answer came.

A mere profession\nof godliness is worthless. It is he that abideth in Christ that is a\nChristian....\nIn every clime, in every nation, our youth should cooperate with\nGod. The only way a person can be pure is to become like-minded\nwith God. How can we know God? By studying His Word....\nUnless the mind of God becomes the mind of man, every effort\nto purify himself will be useless; for it is impossible to elevate man\nexcept through a knowledge of God. The outward gloss may be put\non, and men may be as were the Pharisees whom Jesus describes as\n“whited sepulchres,” full of corruption and dead men’s bones. But\nall the deformity of the soul is open to Him who judgeth righteously,\nand unless the truth is planted in the heart, it cannot control the life.\nCleansing the outside of the cup will never make the vessel pure\nwithin. A nominal acceptance of truth is good as far as it goes, and\nthe ability to give a reason for our faith is a good accomplishment,\nbut if the truth does not go deeper than this, the soul will never be\nsaved. The heart must be purified from all moral defilement. “I\nknow also my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in\nuprightness.” 1 Chronicles 29:17. “Search me, O God, and know my\n288 OurHighCalling\nheart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked\nway in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.” Psalm 139:23, 24."

The question to be settled is, Is the\nconsciencein harmonywiththeWordofGod? Ifnot, itcannotsafely\nbe followed, for it will deceive. The conscience must be enlightened\nby God.

You may be hourly in communion with Heaven;\nit is not the will of your heavenly Father that you should ever be\nunder condemnation and darkness. It is not pleasing to God that you\nshould demerit yourself. You should cultivate self-respect by living\nso that you will be approved by your own conscience, and before\nmen and angels.... It is your privilege to go to Jesus and be cleansed,\nand to stand before the law without shame and remorse. “There is\ntherefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus,\nwho walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” Romans 8:1. While\nwe should not think of ourselves more highly than we ought, the\nWord of God does not condemn a proper self-respect.

If worldliness is allowed to come\nin, if we have no desire to pray, no desire to commune with Him who\nis the source of strength and wisdom, the Spirit will not abide with\nus. Those who are unbelieving do not receive the rich endowment of\ngrace that would make them wise unto salvation, patient, forbearing,\nquick to perceive and appreciate heavenly ministrations, quick to\ndiscern Satan’s devices, and strong to resist sin.\nThe religion of Christ means more than the forgiveness of sin;\nit means that sin is taken away, and that the vacuum is filled with\nthe Spirit. It means that the mind is divinely illumined, that the\nheart is emptied of self, and filled with the presence of Christ. When\n312 OurHighCalling\nthis work is done for church members, the church will be a living,\nworking church."

Matthew 3:16, 17.\nWhat does this scene mean to us? How thoughtlessly we have\nread the account of the baptism of our Lord, not realizing that its\nsignificance was of the greatest importance to us, and that Christ\nwas accepted of the Father in man’s behalf. As Jesus bowed on the\nbanks of Jordan and offered up His petition, humanity was presented\nto the Father by Him who had clothed His divinity with humanity.\nJesus offered Himself to the Father in man’s behalf, that those who\nhad been separated from God through sin, might be brought back to\nGod through the merits of the divine Petitioner....\nThe prayer of Christ in behalf of lost humanity cleaved its way\nthrougheveryshadowthatSatan hadcastbetween man andGod, and\nleft a clear channel of communication to the very throne of glory....\nThe voice of God was heard in answer to the petition of Christ,\nand this tells the sinner that his prayer will find a lodgment at the\nthrone of the Father.

God’s response to such a prayer is, A new heart will I\ngive you. This is a work that no finite man can do. Men and women\nare to begin at the beginning, seeking God most earnestly for a true\nChristian experience. They are to feel the creative power of the Holy\nSpirit. They are to receive the new heart, that is kept soft and tender\nby the grace of heaven. The selfish spirit is to be cleansed from the\nsoul. They are to labor earnestly and with humility of heart, each\none looking to Jesus for guidance and encouragement. Then the\nbuilding, fitly framed together, will grow into a holy temple in the\nLord.\nThe youth especially stumble over this phrase, “a new heart.”\nThey do not know what it means. They look for a special change\nto take place in their feelings. This they term conversion. Over\nthis error thousands have stumbled to ruin, not understanding the\nexpression, “Ye must be born again.” John 3:7.\nSatan leads people to think that because they have felt a rapture\nof feeling, they are converted. But their experience does not change.\nTheir actions are the same as before. Their lives show no good\nfruit. They pray often and long, and are constantly referring to the\nfeelings they had at such and such a time. But they do not live the\nnew life. They are deceived. Their experience goes no deeper than\nfeeling. They build upon the sand, and when adverse winds come,\ntheir house is swept away....\nWhen Jesus speaks of the new heart, He means the mind, the\nlife, the whole being. To have a change of heart is to withdraw the\naffections from the world, and fasten them upon Christ. To have a\nSignoftheNewHeart,June2 323\nnew heart is to have a new mind, new purposes, new motives. What\nis the sign of a new heart?—A changed life."

Professed followers of Christ may possess many\ngood and useful qualities; but their characters are greatly marred\nby an unkind, fretful, faultfinding, harshly judging temper. The\nhusband or the wife who cherishes suspicion and distrust creates\ndissension and strife in the home.

The path\nthat leads away from God, away from His holy, perfect standard\nof right, is always crooked and dangerous. Yet ... many have been\nwalking in this path of transgression. In many cases they did not\nstart right in childhood and youth, and they have pursued crooked\npaths all the way along.

We are brought\nin contact with others. We meet persons who are erring, who do\nwrong in various ways; they may be disagreeable, quick, passionate,\ndictatorial.

These gifts are bestowed, not to be abused and corrupted,\nbut to be used to His honor and glory in the uplifting of humanity....\nThe relation that exists between mind and body is very intimate:\nwhen one is affected, the other is always more or less in sympathy.\nIt is impossible for men, while under the power of sinful, health-\ndestroying habits, to appreciate sacred truths. When the intellect\nis clouded, the moral powers are enfeebled, and sin does not look\nsinful. The most ennobling, grand, and glorious themes of God’s\nWordseem butidle tales. Satan can then easily snatchaway the good\nseed that has been sown in the heart; for the soul is in no condition\nto comprehend or understand its true value. It is thus that selfish,\nhealth-destroying indulgences are counteracting the influence of the\nmessage which is to prepare a people for the great day of God.\nWe are living in a most solemn, awful moment of this earth’s\nhistory. Not a soul whose life is one of careless self-degradation,\nthrough transgression of physical laws, will stand in the great day of\ntrial just before us. There is a terrible account to be rendered to God\nby those who have but little regard for the human body, and treat it\nruthlessly. ... True religion and the laws of health go hand in hand.\nThe least departure from the strictest integrity under any circum-\nstances because it is convenient, will harden the conscience and\nprepare the way for the violation of moral obligations in other ways.\nIf we treat the health of the body, which is our highest earthly inter-\n538 OurHighCalling\nest, without due consideration, we prepare the way for temptation\nand the violation of higher claims."

Men and women should be informed\nin regard to the human habitation, fitted up by our Creator as His\ndwelling place, and over which He desires us to be faithful stew-\nards.... Our bodies are wonderfully made, and the Lord requires\nus to keep them in order. All are under obligation to Him to keep\nthe human structure in a healthful, wholesome condition, that every\nmuscle, every organ, may be used in the service of God.... God,\nwho formed the wonderful structure of the body, will take special\ncare to keep it in order, if men cooperate, instead of working at\ncross-purposes, with Him.\nThese grand truths must be given to the world. We must reach\nthe people where they are, and by example and precept lead them\nto see the beauties of the better way. The world is in sad need of\ninstruction along these lines. The time has come when each soul\nmust be staunch and true to every ray of light God has given, and\nbegin in earnest to give this gospel of health to the people.

        "content": "God has given every youth the talent of speech to be improved\nfor Him. This is a most important trust.... Let your words be life-\ngiving, pointing those around you to the Saviour. Let them bring\nsunshine instead of gloom, harmony instead of animosity. Say noth-\ning that you would not be willing to say in the presence of Jesus\nand the angels. Utter no word that will stir up strife in another heart.\nHowever provoked you may feel, restrain the hasty word. If you are\nChristlike in speech and action, those who associate with you will\nbe blessed by the association. Righteous words and deeds have a\nmore powerful influence for good than all the sermons that can be\npreached.\nLet us guard against speaking words that discourage. Let us\nresolve neverto engage in evilspeaking andbackbiting. Letus refuse\nto serve Satan by implanting seeds of doubt. Let us guard against\ncherishing unbelief, or expressing it to others. Many, many times\nI have wished that there might be circulated a pledge containing a\nsolemn promise to speak only those words that are pleasing to God.\nThere is a great need for such a pledge as there is for one against\nthe use of intoxicating liquor. Let us begin to discipline the tongue,\nremembering always that we can do this only by disciplining the\nmind, for “out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.”\nMatthew 12:34.\nThrough the help that Christ can give, we shall be able to learn\nto bridle the tongue. Sorely as He was tried on the point of hasty\nand angry speech, He never once sinned with His lips. With patient\ncalmness He met the sneers, the taunts, and the ridicule of His\nfellow workers at the carpenter’s bench. Instead of retorting angrily,\nHe would begin to sing one of David’s beautiful psalms; and His\ncompanions, before realizing what they were doing, would unite\n588 OurHighCalling\nwith Him in the hymn. What a transformation would be wrought in\nthis world if men and women today would follow Christ’s example\nin the use of words!"

Those who jest and joke and indulge\nin cheap conversation place themselves upon a level where Satan\ncan gain access to them....

I speak to you\nas a class and also as individuals: Guard your words. Let sobriety\nand sound common sense characterize your conversation. Do not\ntrifle with the purity and nobility of your souls by condescending\nto indulgence in stale jokes, and in cultivating habits of trifling\nconversation.\nThe requirement of God is explicit on these points, and presents\nbefore you the obligations that rest upon you as children of God.\nThe Word of God says, “Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all\nin the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father\nby him.” Colossians 3:17.\nO that every one of our youth would realize the evil of foolish\nconversation, and correct the habit of speaking idle words! Let\nevery one who has indulged in this sin repent of it, confess it before\nGod, and put it far from him. In speaking foolish words, you have\ndishonored the name of Christ; for you have misrepresented Him\nin character. No word of guile was found in His lips, no word of\nprevarication or falsehood.

Here and there an individual member of a\nfamily is true to the convictions of his conscience, and is compelled\nto stand alone.... The line of demarcation is made distinct.

The Comforter is called the Spirit of truth\nbecause there is comfort and hope and peace in the truth. Falsehood\ncannot give genuine peace; this can be received only through the\ntruth....\nJesus prayed that His followers might be one; but we are not\nto sacrifice the truth in order to secure this union, for we are to be\nsanctified through the truth. Here is the foundation of all true peace.\nHuman wisdom would change all this, pronouncing this basis too\nnarrow. Men would try to effect unity through concession to popular\nopinion, through compromise with the world, a sacrifice of vital\ngodliness. But truth is God’s basis for the unity of His people.\nSanctification, unity, peace—all are to be ours through the truth.\nThe belief of the truth does not make men gloomy and uncomfort-\nable. If you have peace in Christ, His precious blood is speaking\npardon and hope to your soul. Yes, more, you have joy in the Holy\nSpirit, through accepting the precious promises. Jesus says, “In\nthe world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have\novercome the world.” John 16:33. Therefore the world shall not\novercome you if you believe in Me. It is a world that I have con-\nquered. Because I have overcome, if you believe in Me, you shall\novercome....\nAll that Jesus has promised, He will fulfill; and it is greatly\ndishonoring to Him for us to doubt Him. All His words are spirit\nand life. Accepted and obeyed, they will give peace and happiness\nand assurance forever.... Christ declares that He has given us peace;\nit belongs to us. And He has spoken these things, that in Him we\nmay have that which through infinite sacrifice He had purchased\nfor us—what He holds as ours. This peace we need not seek in the\n664 OurHighCalling\nworld, for the world has it not to bestow. It is in Christ. He will give\nit, in spite of the world, notwithstanding its threats and decrees, its\nalluring, deceiving promises."

It sends strong roots deep down into the earth, and\nstrikes down farther and still farther in search of a still stronger hold.\nAnd in the fierce blast of the tempest, it stands firm, held by its\nnetwork of cables beneath.\nSo the Christian strikes root deep into Christ.

Genuine Christians, like the cedar of\nLebanon, do not grow in the soft surface soil, but are rooted in God,\nriveted in the clefts of the mountain rocks.\nIf the Christian thrives and progresses at all, he must do so amid\nstrangers to God, amid scoffing, subject to ridicule. He must stand\nupright like the palm tree in the desert. The sky may be as brass, the\ndesert sand may beat about the palm tree’s roots, and pile itself in\nheaps about its trunk.

Ezekiel 20:19, 20.\nThe Sabbath was given to all mankind to commemorate the work\nof Creation. The great Jehovah, when He had laid the foundations\nof the earth, when he had dressed the whole world in its garb of\nbeauty, and created all the wonders of the land and the sea, instituted\nthe Sabbath day and made it holy. When the morning stars sang\ntogether, and all the sons of God shouted for joy, the Sabbath was\nset apart as God’s memorial. God sanctified and blessed the day in\nwhich he had rested from all His wondrous work....\nAs the tree of knowledge was placed in the midst of the Garden\nof Eden, so the Sabbath command is placed in the midst of the\nDecalogue. In regard to the fruit of the tree of knowledge, the\nrestriction was made, “Ye shall not eat of it, ... lest ye die.” Genesis\n3:3. Of the Sabbath God said, Ye shall not defile it, but keep it holy.\n“Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.” Exodus 20:8. As the\ntree of knowledge was the test of Adam’s obedience, so the fourth\ncommand is the test that God has given to prove the loyalty of all\nHis people.\nThe Sabbath is a token between God and His people. It is a holy\nday, given by the Creator to man as a day upon which to rest, and\nreflect upon sacred things. God designed it to be observed through\nevery age as a perpetual covenant. It was to be regarded as a peculiar\ntreasure, a trust to be carefully cherished.\nAs we observe the Sabbath let us remember that it is the sign\nwhich heaven has given to man that he is accepted in the Beloved;\nthatifhe is obedient, he may enterthe city ofGod, andpartake ofthe\nfruit of the tree of life.

But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will\nnot serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast\nset up.” Daniel 3:16-18. It cost them something to confess Christ,\nfor their lives were at stake.\nThen the king commanded that the furnace be heated seven\ntimes hotter than it was wont to be heated, and the faithful children\nof God were cast into the furnace. “Then Nebuchadnezzar the king\nwas astonished, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his\ncounsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of\nthe fire?

A Christian experi-\nence alone can help us to understand this problem, and obtain the\ntreasures of knowledge which have been hidden in the counsels of\nGod, but are now made known to all who have a vital connection\nwith Christ.\nIn Christ dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily. This is why,\nalthoughHe was temptedin allpoints like as we are, He stoodbefore\nthe world, from His first entrance into it, untainted by corruption,\nthough surrounded by it. Are we not also to become partakers of\n734 OurHighCalling\nthat fullness, and is it not thus, and thus only, that we can overcome\nas He overcame?\nThrough His sacrifice, human beings may reach the high ideal\nset before them, and hear at last the words, “Ye are complete in him.”"

        "content": "The themes of redemption are momentous themes, and only\nthose who are spiritually-minded can discern their depth and signifi-\ncance. It is our safety, our joy, to dwell upon the truths of the plan\nof salvation. Faith and prayer are necessary in order that we may\nbehold the deep things of God. Our minds are so bound about by\nnarrow ideas that we catch but limited views of the experience it is\nour privilege to have....\nWhy is it that many who profess to have faith in Christ have\nno strength to stand against the temptations of the enemy?—It is\nbecause they are not strengthened with might by His Spirit in the\ninner man. The apostle prays “that ye, being rooted and grounded in\nlove, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth,\nand length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ,\nwhich passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness\nof God.” Ephesians 3:17-19. If we had this experience, we should\nknow something of the cross of Calvary. We would know what\nit means to be partakers with Christ in His sufferings. The love\nof Christ would constrain us, and though we would not be able to\nexplainhowtheloveofChristwarmedourhearts,wewouldmanifest\nHis love in fervent devotion to His cause.\nPaul opens before the Ephesian church, in the most compre-\nhensive language, the marvelous power and knowledge they might\npossess as sons and daughters of the Most High. It was theirs “to be\nstrengthened with might,” ... to be “rooted and grounded in love,” ...\n“to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge”....\nJehovah Emmanuel—He in whom are hid all the treasures of\nwisdom and knowledge—to be brought into sympathy with Him,\nto possess Him, as the heart opens more and more to receive His\n736 OurHighCalling\nattributes: to know His love and power, to possess the unsearchable\nriches of Christ ... this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord,\nand “their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.” Isaiah 54:17."

Through the merits of Christ, we have access to\nthe throne of infinite power. “He that spared not his own Son, but\ndelivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely\ngive us all things?” Romans 8:32....\nThe heart that has once tasted of the love of Christ, cries out\ncontinually for a deeper draft; and as you impart, you will receive in\nricher and more abundant measure. Every revelation of God to the\nsoul increases the capacity to know and to love. The continual cry\nof the heart is, More of thee, and ever the Spirit’s answer is, Much\nmore....\nThe life of Christ was a life charged with a divine message of\nthe love of God, and He longed intensely to impart this love to\nothers in rich measure. Compassion beamed from His countenance,\nand His conduct was characterized by grace and humility, love and\ntruth. Every member of His church militant must manifest the same\nqualities, if he would join the church triumphant. The love of Christ\nis so broad, so full of glory, that in comparison to it, everything that\nman esteems so great dwindles into insignificance. When we obtain\na view of it, we exclaim, O the depth of the riches of the love that\nGod bestowed upon men in the gift of His only begotten Son! ...\nIt is the mystery of God in the flesh, God in Christ, divinity\nin humanity. Christ bowed down in unparalleled humility, that in\nHis exaltation to the throne of God He might also exalt those who\nbelieve in Him to a seat with Him upon His throne.... “Exceeding\nabundantly above all that we ask or think,” will be given unto us “the\nspirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him” (Ephesians\n1:17), that we may be able to “comprehend with all saints what is\n738 OurHighCalling\nthe breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love\nof Christ, which passeth knowledge,” that we may be “filled with all\nthe fulness of God.”"

You must believe in Christ as a personal Saviour.\nMany of us do not realize the covenant relation in which we\nstand before God as His people.

Our High Calling is made\nup of choice selections from this vast treasury as found in Ellen G.\nWhite articles that appeared week by week in the journals of the\nchurch, herpublic discourses, hermanuscripts, and letters of counsel\nto individuals, many of them Seventh-day Adventist youth.\nIt is clear that Mrs. White contemplated the use of these mes-\nsages in the production of books, for she indicated in a statement\nwritten in 1905 that “I am endeavoring by the help of God to write\nletters that will be a help, not merely to those to whom they are ad-\ndressed, but to many others who need them.” Although written many\nyears ago, these counsels speak to our hearts today, to encourage,\ninstruct, and inspire us in victorious practical everyday Christian\nliving and witnessing, particularly in view of the imminence of our\nLord’s return.\nTo make the reading for each day complete within the limits of a\nsingle page, it has been necessary at times to make deletions in order\nto bring the reading to the right length. All deletions are indicated\nin the usual manner. Likewise, in many instances material on a page\nhas been drawn from more than one source. Great care has been\nexercised to avoid any distortion of meaning, and that which appears\nclearly presents the intent of the author. Proper source references\nfor each quotation are given, whether article, pamphlet, manuscript,\nor book.\nOur High Calling, presenting a devotional reading for each day\nintroduced by an appropriate Bible text, has been prepared as an\nenrichment of the Morning Watch devotional plan and appears si-\nmultaneously in several languages. That this volume, comprised of\nmessages inspired by the Spirit of God, will be treasured as other\nlike volumes have been in the past, and will be the means of encour-\nxiv\nForeword xv\naging all who read to “press toward the mark for the prize of the\nhigh calling of God in Christ Jesus” is our sincere wish.\nThe Trustees of the Ellen G.
