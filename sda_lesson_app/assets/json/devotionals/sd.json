        "content": "Foreword\nFrom a life rich in experience and a heart enlightened by divine\nrevelations, Ellen G. White, as she journeyed along life’s pathway,\nwas ever ready to lend a helping hand or speak an encouraging\nword. Every Christian was to her a son or a daughter of God, with\nunlimited opportunities stretching before him, and angels of God\nby his side to guard and guide him. From her tireless and inspired\npen there flowed a steady stream of messages of encouragement,\ncounsel, instruction, andenlightenment. Fromweektoweekthrough\nthe Youth’s Instructor she spoke to the youth of the church, and in\nthe Review and Herald addressed its members generally. Her books\npreserved the instruction and warning in more permanent form for\nall to read. Many benefited by communications addressed to them\npersonally.\nIn this volume, with its daily devotional readings, have been\nassembled appropriate counsel and instruction drawn from these\naccumulated E. G. White writings as kept on file in the office of\nthe Ellen G. White Publications. Many times the message of the\nday reflects a freshness of approach as Ellen White, under the varied\ncircumstances of her experience, passed on words of cheer and\nencouragement. In each case, whether drawn from book, periodical\narticle, or manuscript, the source reference is given. The volume\nhas been compiled under the direction of the Trustees with whom\nMrs. White left the care of her writings, and in harmony with her\ndirections to this Board.\nIt can readily be seen that in an endeavor to hold the reading\nof each day to one printed page and at the same time give a well-\nrounded presentation, it has been necessary at times to shorten some\nof the statements selected. Such omissions are indicated by marks\nof ellipsis.\nThat this volume may lead each reader to a deeper appreciation\nof what it means to be a child of God, is the sincere wish of the\nPublishers and\nxiv\nForeword xv\nThe Trustees of the Ellen G. WhitePublications.\nWashington, D.C.\nxvi SonsandDaughtersofGod\nGod\nThat God Created Man in His Own Image, January\nGod created man in his own image, in the image of God\ncreated he him; male and female created he them. Genesis\n1:27.\nAll heaven took a deep and joyful interest in the creation of the\nworld and of man. Human beings were a new and distinct order.\nThey were made “in the image of God,” and it was the Creator’s\ndesign that they should populate the earth. They were to live in close\ncommunion with heaven, receiving power from the Source of all\npower. Upheld by God, they were to live sinless lives.1\nThe holy pair were not only children under the fatherly care of\nGod, but students receiving instruction from the all-wise Creator.\nThey were visited by angels, and were granted communion with\ntheir Maker, with no obscuring veil between.... The mysteries of\nthe visible universe—“the wondrous works of him who is perfect\nin knowledge”—afforded them an exhaustless source of instruction\nand delight. The laws and operations of nature, which have engaged\nmen’s study for six thousand years, were opened to their minds by\nthe infinite Framer and Upholder of all. They held converse with leaf\nand flower and tree, gathering from each the secrets of its life. With\nevery living creature, from the mighty leviathan that playeth among\nthe waters, to the insect mote that floats in the sunbeam, Adam was\nfamiliar. He had given to each its name, and he was acquainted\nwith the nature and habits of all. God’s glory in the heavens, the\ninnumerable worlds in their orderly revolutions, “the balancings of\nthe clouds,” the mysteries of light and sound, of day and night,—all\nwere open to the study of our first parents.2\nGod created man a superior being; he alone is formed in the\nimage of God, and is capable of partaking of the divine nature, of\ncooperating with his Creator and executing His plans.3\nThat we should be Called the Sons of God, January [8]\nBehold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon\nus, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the\nworld knoweth us not; because it knew him not. 1 John 3:1.\nAs John thought of the love of Christ, he was led to exclaim,\n“Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,\nthat we should be called the sons of God.”\nPeoplethinkitaprivilegetoseearoyalpersonage, andthousands\ngo great distances to see one. How much greater privilege it is to be\nsons and daughters of the Most High. What greater privilege could\nbe conferred on us than to be given entrance into the royal family?\nIn order to become the sons and daughters of God, we must\nseparate from the world. “Come out from among them, and be ye\nseparate,” the Lord says, “and I will be a Father unto you, and ye\nshall be my sons and daughters.” ...\nThere is a heaven before us, a crown of life to win. But to the\novercomer only is the reward given. He who gains heaven must be\nclothed with the robe of righteousness. “Every man that hath this\nhope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.” In the character\nof Christ there was no discord of any kind. And this must be our\nexperience. Our lives must be controlled by the principles that\ncontrolled His life.4\nThrough the perfection of the sacrifice given for the guilty race,\nthose who believe in Christ, coming unto Him, may be saved from\neternal ruin....\nLet no one be so deluded by the enemy as to think that it is a\ncondescension for any man, however talented or learned or honored,\nto accept Christ. Every human being should look to heaven with\nreverence and gratitude, and exclaim with amazement, “Behold,\nwhat manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we\nshould be called the sons of God.”5\n[9] That when Christ Appears we Shall be Like Him,\nBeloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet\nappear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall\nappear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. 1\nJohn 3:2.\nWe are not to settle down, expecting that a change of character\nwill come to us by some miraculous work, when Jesus shall appear\nin the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. No, my young\nfriends, we are judgment-bound, and probation is granted to us here\nin this life, in order that we may form characters for the future,\nimmortal life.6\nLet none imagine that selfishness, self-esteem, and self-indul-\ngence are compatible with the Spirit of Christ. Upon every truly\nconverted man or woman there rests a responsibility that we cannot\nrightly estimate. The maxims and ways of the world are not to be\nadopted by the sons and daughters of the heavenly King.7\nIn separating from the world, we shall encounter difficulties on\nevery hand. But here is comfort for us: “Beloved, now are we the\nsons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we\nknow that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall\nsee him as he is.”8\nWe should show by our words and works that we recognize the\ngreat responsibility laid upon us. Our light should shine so clearly\nthat others can see that we glorify the Father in our daily lives; that\nwe are connected with heaven and are joint heirs with Jesus Christ.9\nTo have fellowship with the Father and His Son Jesus Christ is to\nbe ennobled and elevated, and made a partaker of joys unspeakable\nand full of glory. Food, clothing, station, and wealth may have\ntheir value; but to have a connection with God ... is of priceless\nvalue.... And although it “doth not yet appear what we shall be,”\n“when Christ, who is our life, shall appear,” “we shall be like him.”10"

        "verse": "And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. 1 John 3:3.",
        "verse_ref": "1 John 3:3",
        "content": "Christ would elevate and refine man’s mind, purifying it from\nall dross, that he may appreciate the love that is without a parallel.11\nThrough repentance, faith, and good works he may perfect a\nrighteous character, and claim, through the merits of Christ, the priv-\nilegesofthesonsofGod. Theprinciplesofdivinetruth, receivedand\ncherished in the heart, will carry us to a height of moral excellence\nthat we had not deemed it possible for us to reach.... “And every man\nthat hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.”12\nHoliness of heart and purity of life were the great subjects of the\nteachings of Christ. In His sermon on the mount, after specifying\nwhatmustbe done in orderto be blessed, andwhatmustnotbe done,\nHe says, “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in\nheaven is perfect.” Perfection, holiness,—nothing shortofthis would\ngive them success in carrying out the principles He had given them.\nWithout this holiness, the human heart is selfish, sinful, and vicious.\nHoliness will lead its possessor to be fruitful, and abound in all good\nworks. He will never become weary in well-doing; neither look for\npromotion in this world; but he will look forward to be promoted by\nthe Majesty of heaven when He shall exalt His sanctified and holy\nones to His throne.... Holiness of heart will produce right actions.13\nAs God is pure in His sphere, so man is to be pure in his. And\nhe will be pure if Christ is formed within, the hope of glory; for he\nwill imitate Christ’s life and reflect His character.14\nThe princely dignity of the Christian character will shine forth\nas the sun, and the beams of light from the face of Christ will be\nreflected upon those who have purified themselves even as He is\npure.15\nPurity of heart will lead to purity of life.16\n[11] That God Sent His Son to Die That We Might Live,\nHerein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and\nsent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 1 John 4:10.\nIn redemption God has revealed His love in sacrifice, a sacrifice\nso broad and deep and high that it is immeasurable. “God so loved\nthe world that he gave his only begotten son....”\nWhen Adam’s sin plunged the race into hopeless misery, God\nmight have cut Himself loose from fallen beings. He might have\ntreated them as sinners deserved to be treated. He might have com-\nmanded the angels of heaven to pour out upon our world the vials of\nHis wrath. He might have removed this dark blot from His universe.\nBut He did not do this. Instead of banishing them from His presence,\nHe came still nearer to the fallen race. He gave His Son to become\nbone of our bone and flesh of our flesh. “The Word was made flesh,\nand dwelt among us, ... full of grace and truth.” Christ by His hu-\nman relationship to men drew them close to God. He clothed His\ndivine nature with the garb of humanity, and demonstrated before\nthe heavenly universe, before the unfallen worlds, how much God\nloves the children of men.\nThe gift of God to man is beyond all computation. Nothing was\nwithheld. God would not permit it to be said that He could have\ndone more or revealed to humanity a greater measure of love. In the\ngift of Christ He gave all heaven.\nThe Highest, who was with the Father before the world was,\nsubmitted to humiliation, that He might uplift humanity. Prophecy\nwithdraws the veil, that we may behold the throne of heaven, that\nwe may see upon that throne, high and lifted up, One who in human\nform, came to our world to suffer, to be lacerated with stripes, and\nbruised for our iniquities.17\nThatGodSentHisSontoDieThatWeMightLive,January5 23\nThus God showed His love for man. With Christ He gave all\nheaven, that the moral image of God might be restored in man....\nHis grace in all its vastness is provided for all.18\n[12] That Power is Given us to Become the Sons of God,\nBut as many as received him, to them gave he power to become\nthe sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. John\n1:12.\nDivine sonship is not something that we gain of ourselves. Only\nto those who receive Christ as their Saviour is given the power to\nbecome sons anddaughters ofGod. The sinnercannot, byanypower\nof his own, rid himself of sin. For the accomplishment of this result,\nhe must look to a higher Power. John exclaimed, “Behold the Lamb\nof God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” Christ alone has\npower to cleanse the heart. He who is seeking for forgiveness and\nacceptance can say only,—\n“Nothing in my hand I bring;\nSimply to Thy cross I cling.”\nBut the promise of sonship is made to all who “believe on his name.”\nEvery one who comes to Jesus in faith will receive pardon.19\nThe religion of Christ transforms the heart. It makes the worldly-\nminded man heavenly-minded. Under its influence the selfish man\nbecomes unselfish, because this is the character of Christ. The\ndishonest, scheming man becomes upright, so thatitis secondnature\nto him to do to others as he would have others do to him. The\nprofligate is changed from impurity to purity. He forms correct\nhabits; for the gospel of Christ has become to him a savor of life\nunto life.20\nGod was to be manifest in Christ, “reconciling the world unto\nhimself.” Man had become so degraded by sin that it was impossible\nfor him, in himself, to come into harmony with Him whose nature is\npurity and goodness. But Christ, after having redeemed man from\nthe condemnation of the law, could impart divine power, to unite\nThatPowerisGivenustoBecometheSonsofGod,January6 25\nwith human effort. Thus by repentance toward God and faith in\nChrist, the fallen children of Adam might once more become “sons\nof God.”21\nWhen a soul receives Christ, he receives power to live the life of\nChrist.22\n[13] That the Church Is the Object of God’s Supreme"

Christ\ncame off conqueror, bearing the test and trial in our behalf. How\nlittle is man able to comprehend the strength of the temptation of\nChrist! Howlittledoesheunderstandofthatordealuponwhichhung\nthe destiny of a lost world! The world’s Redeemer was not warring\nagainstfleshandblood, butagainstprincipalities andpowers, against\nthe rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness\nin high places. All heaven was interested in this conflict, and what\njoy, what rejoicing there was in heaven because help had been laid\nupon One who is mighty to overcome, mighty to save!\nWhat an event was this when Christ placed Himself in the posi-\ntion of Adam, and endured the test where Adam had failed, and by\nthis act placed man on a vantage ground, in favor with God, where\nhe might overcome on his own account through the merits of Jesus.\nIn His name, through His grace, man may be an overcomer, even\nas Christ was an overcomer. In Christ divinity and humanity were\nunited, and the only way in which man may be an overcomer is\nthrough becoming a partaker of the divine nature.... Divinity and\nhumanity are blended in him who has the spirit of Christ. The apos-\ntle Paul writes, “In all things it behooved him to be made like unto\nhis brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest.”\n... “We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the\n42 SonsandDaughtersofGod\nfeeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we\nare, yet without sin.”56\nHe is Stronger and More Mighty Than Our [25]"

He wept\nat the grave of Lazarus, that He could not save every one whom\nSatan’s power had laid low in death. He had given Himself a ransom\nfor many, even all who would avail themselves of the privilege of\ncoming back to their loyalty to God.... When He raised Lazarus\nfrom the dead, He knew that for that life He must pay the ransom\non the cross of Calvary. Every rescue made was to cause Him the\ndeepest humiliation. He was to taste death for every man.\nIn His life on earth, Christ developed a perfect character, He\nrendered perfect obedience to His Father’s commandments. In com-\ning to the world in human form, in becoming subject to the law,\nin revealing to men that He bore their sickness, their sorrow, their\nguilt, He did not become a sinner. Before the Pharisees He could\nsay, “Which of you convinceth me of sin?” Not one stain of sin was\nfound upon Him. He stood before the world the spotless Lamb of\nGod.\nFrom the light of His exalted purity, the world’s Redeemer could\nsee that the maladies from which the human family were suffering\nwere brought upon them by transgression of the law of God. Every\ncase of suffering He could trace back to its source. In every case\nHe read the sad and awful end of unrepenting sinners. He knew that\nHe alone could rescue them from the pit into which they had fallen.\nHe alone could place their feet in the right path; His perfection\nalone could avail for their imperfection. He alone could cover their\nnakedness with His spotless robe of righteousness.... He is strong to\ndeliver. Help has been laid on One that is mighty. He encircles man\n44 SonsandDaughtersofGod\nwith His long human arm, while with His divine arm He lays hold\nof Omnipotence.57"

We should ever seek to\nrealize that the Lord is very near us, to be our counselor and guide.\nThis is the only way in which we may have confidence toward God.\nWe need to educate and train the mind so that we shall have an\nintelligent faith, and have an understanding friendship with Jesus.\nUnless wecontinuallycherishfriendshipbetween Godandoursouls,\nwe shall separate from Him, and walk apart from Him.

Psalm 111:7, 8.\nAdam and Eve, at their creation, had a knowledge of the law of\nGod. It was printed on their hearts, and they understood its claims\nupon them. The law of God existed before man was created. It was\nadapted to the condition of holy beings; even angels were governed\nby it. After the fall, the principles of righteousness were unchanged.\nNothing was taken from the law; not one of its holy precepts could\nbe improved. And as it has existed from the beginning, so will it\ncontinue to exist throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity.1\nOur duty to obey this law is to be the burden of this last message\nof mercy to the world. God’s law is not a new thing. It is not\nholiness created, but holiness made known. It is a code of principles\nexpressing mercy, goodness, and love. It presents to fallen humanity\nthe character of God, and states plainly the whole duty of man.2\nThe law of love being the foundation of the government of God,\nthe happiness of all intelligent beings depends upon their perfect\naccord with its great principles of righteousness. God desires from\nall His creatures the service of love—service that springs from an\nappreciation of His character. He takes no pleasure in a forced\nobedience; and to all He grants freedom of will, that they may\nrender Him voluntary service.3\n“All His commandments are sure....” Whatever is built upon the\nauthority of man will be overthrown; but that which is founded upon\nthe rock of God’s immutable word shall stand forever.4\nThe sacred statutes which Satan has hated and sought to destroy,\nwill be honored throughout a sinless universe.5"

The laws of the nations bear marks of the infirmities and\npassions of the unrenewed heart; but God’s law bears the stamp of\nthe divine.6\nSays the psalmist, “The law of the Lord is perfect.” How wonder-\nful in its simplicity, its comprehensiveness and perfection, is the law\nof Jehovah! It is so brief that we can easily commit every precept\nto memory, and yet so far-reaching as to express the whole will of\nGod, and to take cognizance not only of the outward actions, but\nof the thoughts and intents, the desires and emotions, of the heart.\nHuman laws can not do this. They can deal with the outward actions\nonly. A man may be a transgressor, and yet conceal his misdeeds\nfrom human eyes; he may be a criminal,—a thief, a murderer, or\nan adulterer,—but so long as he is not discovered, the law can not\ncondemn him as guilty....\nThe law of God is simple, and easily understood. If the children\nof men would, to the best of their ability, obey this law, they would\ngain strength of mind and power of discernment to comprehend still\nmore of God’s purposes and plans. And this advancement would be\ncontinued, not only during the present life, but during eternal ages;\nfor however far he may advance in the knowledge of God’s wisdom\nand power, there is always an infinity beyond.7\nSince “the law of the Lord is perfect,” every variation from it\nmust be evil.8\nObedience was the only condition upon which ancient Israel was\nto receive the fulfilment of the promises that made them the highly\nfavored people of God; and obedience to that law will bring as great\nblessings to individuals and nations now as it would have brought to\nthe Hebrews.9"

Through song and prayer, and lessons from the\nScriptures, adapted to the opening mind, fathers and mothers were\nto instruct their children that the law of God is an expression of His\ncharacter, and that as they received the principles of the law into the\nheart, the image of God was traced on mind and soul.17\nIf it was essential for Moses to embody the commandments in\nsacred song, so that as they marched in the wilderness, the children\ncould learn to sing the law verse by verse, how essential it is at this\ntime to teach our children God’s Word!18\nTrue happiness in this life and in the future life depends upon\nobedience to a “Thus saith the Lord.” ...

The\nlaw of ten commandments was of universal obligation. The sacri-\nficial ordinances were devised to represent the one great Sacrifice,\nthe Lamb of God, that was to take away the sin of the world, and in\nbehalf of the transgressor meet the requirements of divine justice.\nThe Lord would not have His people exclusive. Christ’s del-\negated messengers are to proclaim the gospel of His grace to all\nnations, tongues, and people. We are to make it known that the Great\nAdvocate is giving audience to the whole world. The Jewish church\nwas called to be God’s representative to an apostate world, and in\norder to fulfill this mission the Jewish people were to maintain their\nown existence as a nation distinct from all the idolatrous nations\nupon the earth. They were to stand in the world maintaining their\npeculiar and holy character. They could maintain their own spiritu-\nality by doing that which Adam and Eve failed to do,—by rendering\nobedience to all the commandments of God, and in their characters\nrepresenting God’s mercy, goodness, compassion, and love. Thus in\nexcellence of character they could stand above every other nation;\nfor through a pure and obedient people the Lord would manifest\nHis rich blessings. Thus the principles of the laws governing His\nkingdom were to be exalted throughout the world. Just as surely as\nthey responded to the mercy, the light, the grace given, they would\nbecome the light of the world. They would be constantly directing\nattention to God, as a wise, faultless, Supreme Ruler, and the praise\nof God would be in all the earth.... The Lord is our God, and He has\nthe same purpose in regard to His believing, loyal people today.22\nRejoices the Heart and Enlightens the Eyes, [45]\nThe statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the\ncommandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.\nPsalm 19:8.\nWehaveonlyglimmeringlightinregardtotheexceedingbreadth\nof the law of God.... Many of those who claim to believe the testing\ntruths for these last days, act as though God took no note of their\ndisrespect of, and manifest disobedience to, the principles of His\nholy law. The law is the expression of His will, and it is through\nobedience to that law that God proposes to accept the children of\nmen as His sons and daughters.... An infinite sacrifice has been\nmade that the moral image of God may be restored to man, through\nwilling obedience to all the commandments of God. Exceeding\ngreat is our salvation for ample provision has been made through\nthe righteousness of Christ, that we may be pure, entire, wanting\nnothing....

God, in His wisdom and mercy, tests men\nand women here, to see if they will obey His voice and respect His\nlaw, or rebel as Satan did....\nGod’s object in giving the law to the fallen race was that man\nmight, through Jesus, rise from his low estate to be one with God,\nthat the greatest moral changes might be manifested in his nature\nand character.

Love is the fulfilling of the\nlaw; and it is the duty of every child of God to render obedience to\nHis commandments....\nThe law of God, which is perfect holiness, is the only true stan-\ndard of character.

They would have a powerful influence upon the life and\ncharacter of those around them, which would work as leaven amid\nthe mass of humanity, transforming others through the power of\nJesus Christ. Connected with the Source of power, they would never\nlose their vital influence, but would ever increase in efficiency.37\nLove to God must be a living principle, underlying every act\nand word and thought. If in the strength of Christ we are seeking to\nmaintain such a consecration, we shall be daily holding communion\nwith God.... The principles of God’s law will dwell in the heart, and\ncontrol the actions. It will then be as natural for us to seek purity and\nholiness, to shun the spirit and example of the world, and to seek to\nWearetoLovetheLordwithAllOurHearts,February14 79\nbenefit all around us, as it is for the angels of glory to execute the\nmission of love assigned them.38\n[52] We Will Love Our Neighbors as Ourselves,\nThou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Matthew 22:39.\nThe divine law requires us to love God supremely, and ourneigh-\nbor as ourselves. Without the exercise of this love, the highest\nprofession of faith is mere hypocrisy.39\nThe worshiper of God will find that he cannot cherish one fiber\nof the root of selfishness. He cannot do his duty to his God and\npractice oppression toward his fellow men. The second principle\nof the law is like unto the first, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as\nthyself.” “This do and thou shalt live.” These are the words of Jesus\nChrist from which there can be no departure on the part of any man,\nwoman, or youth who would be a true Christian. It is obedience to\ntheprinciplesofthecommandmentsofGod, thatmoldsthecharacter\nafter the divine similitude....\nTo leave a suffering neighbor unrelieved is a breach of the law\nof God.... He who loves God will not only love his fellow men, but\nwill regard with tender compassion the creatures which God has\nmade. When the Spirit of God is in man it leads him to relieve rather\nthan to create suffering.... We are to care for every case of suffering,\nand to look upon ourselves as God’s agents to relieve the needy\nto the very uttermost of our ability. We are to be laborers together\nwith God. There are some who manifest great affection for their\nrelatives, for their friends and favorites, who yet fail to be kind and\nconsiderate to those who need tender sympathy, who need kindness\nand love. With earnest heart, let us inquire, Who is my neighbor?\nOur neighbors are not merely our neighbors and special friends, are\nnot simply those who belong to our church or who think as we do.\nOur neighbors are the whole human family. We are to do good to all\nmen, and especially to those who are of the household of faith. We\nare to give to the world an exhibition of what it means to carry out\nWeWillLoveOurNeighborsasOurselves,February15 81\nthe law of God. We are to love God supremely and our neighbors as\nourselves.40\n[53] Mercy Shown to Thousands Who Love God’s Law,\nAnd shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and\nkeep my commandments. Exodus 20:6.\nThe ten holy precepts spoken by Christ upon Sinai’s mount were\nthe revelation of the character of God, and made known to the world\nthe fact that He had jurisdiction over the whole human heritage.\nThat law of ten precepts of the greatest love that can be presented\nto man is the voice of God from heaven speaking to the soul in\npromise. “This do, and you will not come under the dominion and\ncontrol of Satan.” There is not a negative in that law, although it\nmay appear thus. It is DO, and Live.... The Lord has given His\nholy commandments to be a wall of protection around His created\nbeings.41\nEverything that God could do, He has done to manifest His great\nlove and mercy to you. He “so loved the world, that he gave his only\nbegotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but\nhaveeverlastinglife.”Then restin theassuranceoftheloveofGod....\nNot because we first loved Him did God love us; but “while we were\nyet sinners,” Christ died for us, making full and abundant provision\nfor our redemption. Although by our disobedience we have merited\nGod’s displeasure and condemnation, yet He has not forsaken us,\nleaving us to grapple with the power of the enemy in our own finite\nstrength. Heavenly angels fight our battles for us, and cooperating\nwith them, we may be victorious over the powers of evil.... As we\ndraw nigh to Him by faith, He draws nigh to us, adopting us into\nHis family, and making us His sons and daughters.42\nTo those who are faithful in His service, mercy is promised, not\nmerely to the third and fourth generation ... but to thousands of\ngenerations.43\nThe tender mercies of God are unmeasured, and those who ap-\npreciate the love of Christ will be renewed in true holiness, and\nMercyShowntoThousandsWhoLoveGod’sLaw,February16 83\nbrought into Christ, their living Head. They will be followers of\nGod as dear children.44\n[54] We Love God’s Commandments More Than Gold,\nTherefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above\nfine gold. Psalm 119:127.\nIn these days of peril shall we show less devotion to the truth of\nGod, and less fervent attachment to His law, than in former years?\nThe very condition of things exists which Christ declared would\nbe, prior to His second coming in power and glory. The prevailing\nungodlinesstendstoparalyzeandeven todestroytruefaithandpiety.\nBut this is the very time when the gold of Christian integrity will\nshine brightest, in contrast to the dross of hypocrisy and corruption.\nNow is the time for Christ’s chosen to show their devotion to His\nservice,—the time for all His followers to bear the noblest testimony\nfor their Master by standing firm against the prevailing current of\nevil.\nAs we see the results which have followed a disregard of God’s\nlaw,—dishonesty, theft, licentiousness, drunkenness, and murder,—\nwe are prepared to say with the psalmist, “I love thy commandments\nabove gold; yea, above fine gold”; “in keeping of them, there is great\nreward.” When the divine law is set aside, the greatest misery will\nresult, both to families and to society. Our only hope of better things\nis to be found in a faithful adherence to the precepts of Jehovah.\nInfidel France once tried the experiment of rejecting the authority of\nGod. What scenes of horror followed! Men cast aside the divine law\nas a yoke of bondage, and in their boasted liberty they placed them-\nselves under the rule of the veriest tyrant. Anarchy and bloodshed\nruled that terrible day. It was then demonstrated to the world that the\nsurest way to undermine the foundation of order and government, is\nto set at naught the law of God....\nInstead of feeling that we are now in the slightest degree excus-\nable in further transgression, we shall realize as never before the\njustice of God’s claims upon us, and the sacred character of His\nWeLoveGod’sCommandmentsMoreThanGold,February17 85\nlaw, since Christ must die to maintain its authority. Ere long the\nobedient will see the blessed results that follow the keeping of all\nGod’s commandments.45\n[55] Christ Came to Earth to Fulfill the Law, February\nThink not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I\nam not come to destroy, but to fulfil. Matthew 5:17.\nGod chose Israel as the depositary of priceless treasure of truth\nfor all nations, and He gave them His law as the standard of the\ncharacter they were to develop before the world, before angels, and\nbefore the unfallen worlds.... Through disobedience and disloyalty\nGod’s chosen nation developed a character exactly opposite to the\ncharacter God designed them to develop by obeying His law. They\nplaced their own mold and superscription upon the truth, removing\nfrom it the superscription of God.... The law of God was being\nburied beneath the minutiae of outward forms,—such as the frequent\nwashing of the hands before eating, and the washing of pots and\ncups. Tithes were exacted on simple garden herbs. To those who\nmade so much of these minor things, Christ said, “...these ought ye\nto have done, and not to leave the other undone.” ...\nAmid all this confusing din of voices there was need of a teacher\ndirect from the heavenly universe to speak from inspired lips to\nhuman hearts, and to proclaim the testing truths so important to\nevery one....\nAs a Teacher sent from God, Christ’s work was to explain the\ntrue significance of the laws of God’s government.... Resetting truth\nin the framework of God’s own law, He caused it to shine in its\noriginal, heavenly luster.... He enthroned the divine precepts in\ncompanionship with the royalty of eternal, uncorrupted truth bearing\nthe sanction of God, the Source of all truth....\nChrist came not only to vindicate the law before the inhabitants\nof this world, but by His life to settle forever the immutability of\nGod’s law.... He [God] never lets go one who commits the keeping\nof the soul to His care. Having loved them because of their love of\nJesus, He loves them to the end.46"

        "content": "The ten commandments, Thou shalt, and Thou shalt not, are ten\npromises assured to us if we render obedience to the law governing\nthe universe.47\nThere is not a moral precept enjoined in any part of the Bible\nwhich is not engraved with the finger of God in His holy law on the\ntwo tables of stone. A copy was given to Moses on Mount Sinai.\nThe first four commandments enjoined upon man his duty to serve\nthe Lord our God with all the heart, and with all the soul, and with\nall the mind, and with all the strength. This takes the whole man.\nThis requires a love so fervent, so intense, that man can cherish\nnothing in his mind or affections in rivalry with God; and his works\nwill bear the signature of heaven. Everything is secondary to the\nglory of God. Our heavenly Father is to be ever cherished as the\nfirst, the joy and prosperity, the light and sufficiency of our life, and\nour portion forever.48\nLet men worship and serve the Lord God, and Him only. Let\nnot selfish pride be lifted up and served as a god. Let not money be\nmade a god. If sensuality is not kept under the control of the higher\npowers of the mind, base passion will rule the being. Anything that\nis made the subject of undue thought and admiration, absorbing the\nmind, is a God chosen before the Lord.49\nJehovah, the eternal, self-existent, uncreated One, Himself the\nsource and sustainer of all, is alone entitled to supreme reverence\nand worship. Man is forbidden to give to any other object the first\nplace in his affections or his service. Whatever we cherish that tends\nto lessen our love for God or to interfere with the service due Him,\nof that do we make a god.50\n[57] We Shall Not Serve Any Graven Images, February\nThou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any\nlikeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the\nearth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou\nshalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them. Exodus\n20:4, 5.\nOur Creator demands our supreme devotion, our first allegiance.\nAnything which tends to abate our love for God, or to interfere with\ntheservicedueHim,becomestherebyanidol. Withsometheirlands,\ntheir houses, their merchandise, are the idols. Business enterprises\nare prosecuted with zeal and energy, while the service of God is\nmade a secondary consideration. Family worship is neglected, secret\nprayer forgotten. Many claim to deal justly with their fellow-men,\nandseem to feelthatin so doing theydischarge theirwhole duty. But\nitis notenoughto keep the lastsix commandments ofthe Decalogue.\nWe are to love the Lord our God with all the heart. Nothing short\nof obedience to every precept ... can satisfy the claims of the divine\nlaw.\nThere are many whose hearts have been so hardened by prosper-\nity that they forget God, and forget the wants of their fellow-men.\nProfessed Christians adorn themselves with jewelry, laces, costly\napparel, while the Lord’s poor suffer for the necessaries of life.\nMen and women who claim redemption through a Saviour’s blood\nwill squander the means intrusted to them for the saving of other\nsouls, and then grudging dole out their offerings for religion, giving\nliberally only when it will bring honor to themselves. These are\nidolaters.51\nAnything that diverts the mind from God assumes the form of\nan idol, and that is why there is so little power in the church today.52\nThe second commandment forbids the worship of the true God\nby images or similitudes.... The mind, turned away from the infinite\nWeShallNotServeAnyGravenImages,February20 89\nperfection of Jehovah, would be attracted to the creature rather than\nto the Creator.53\nGod is a searcher of the heart. He distinguishes between true\nheart-service and idolatry.54\n[58] We Shall Not Take the Name of the Lord in Vain,\nThou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for\nthe Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in\nvain. Exodus 20:7.\nThe reason for this command is given: we are not to swear “by\nthe heaven, for it is the throne of God; nor by the earth, for it is the\nfootstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great\nKing. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make\none hair white or black.” All things come of God. We have nothing\nthat we have not received; and, more than this, we have nothing that\nhas not been purchased for us by the blood of Christ.55\nBurning words of passion should never be spoken, for in the\nsight of God and holy angels they are as a species of swearing.56\nThis commandment not only prohibits false oaths and common\nswearing, but it forbids us to use the name of God in a light or\ncareless manner, without regard to its awful significance. By the\nthoughtless mention of God in common conversation, by appeals to\nHim in trivial matters, and by the frequent and thoughtless repetition\nof His name, we dishonor Him. “Holy and reverend in his name.”\nAll should meditate upon His majesty, His purity and holiness, that\nthe heart may be impressed with a sense of His exalted character;\nand His holy name should be uttered with reverence and solemnity.57\nIt is not men whom we are to exalt and worship; it is God, the\nonly true and living God, to whom our worship and reverence are\ndue. According to the teaching of the Scriptures, it dishonors God\nto address ministers as “reverend.” No mortal has any right to attach\nthis to his own name, or to the name of any other human being. It\nbelongs only to God, to distinguish Him from every other being....\n“Holy and reverend is his name.” We dishonor God when we use\nthis word where it does not belong.... The Father and the Son alone\nare to be exalted.58"

The seventh day is a\nGod-given memorial.59\nPointing to God as the maker of the heavens and the earth, it\ndistinguishes the true God from all false gods.

Acts of neces-\nsity and mercy are permitted on the Sabbath, the sick and suffering\nare at all times to be cared for; but unnecessary labor is to be strictly\navoided.... And the commandment includes all within our gates. The\ninmates of the house are to lay aside their worldly business during\nthe sacred hours. All should unite to honor God by willing service\nupon His holy day.60\nSo long as the heavens and the earth endure, the Sabbath will\ncontinue as a sign of the Creator’s power.

The Heart-searcher knows what is your\nattitude toward your parents; for He is weighing moral character in\nthe golden scales of the heavenly sanctuary.

Matthew\n11:29.\nOnly by the aid of the divine Teacher can we understand the\ntruths of God’s Word. In His school we shall learn how to be\nmeek and lowly. He shows us how to understand the mysteries of\ngodliness.4\nLet those who desire an education of the highest kind, learn ...\nthat God is nigh unto all who seek Him with the whole heart.\nThe more one sees of the character of God, the more humble he\nbecomes, and the lower his estimation is of himself. This indeed\nis the evidence that he beholds God, that he is in union with Jesus\nChrist. Unless we are meek and lowly, we cannot in truth claim that\nwe have any conception of the character of God. Men may think that\nthey possess superior qualifications. Their splendid talents, great\nlearning, eloquence, activity, and zeal, may dazzle the eye, delight\nthe fancy, and awaken the admiration of those who cannot read\nbeneath the surface; but unless humility and modesty is linked with\nthese other gifts, self-glorification and self-exaltation will be seen.\nUnless each qualification is consecrated to the Lord, unless those to\nwhom the Lord has entrusted gifts seek that grace which alone can\nmake their qualifications acceptable to God, they are looked upon\nby the Lord ... as unprofitable servants. “The sacrifices of God are\na broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God thou wilt not\ndespise.” ... Those whose hearts are melted and subdued, who have\nseen the glorious manifestation of God’s character, will show no\nheedless presumption.... Self will be lost in the consciousness they\nhave of God’s wonderful glory, and their own utter unworthiness.\nAll who value a happy and holy walk with God ... will leave nothing\nundone if only they may gain a glimpse of His glory. In every place\nand under every circumstance, they will pray to God that they may\n104 SonsandDaughtersofGod\nbe allowed to see Him. They will cherish that meek and contrite\nspirit that trembles at the word of God.5\nHe Teaches Us His Yoke is Easy, His Burden, Light, [69]\nFor my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. Matthew 11:30.\nWe are to bear the yoke of Christ that we may be placed in\ncomplete union with Him. “Take my yoke upon you,” He says....\nWearing the yoke unites finite man in companionship with the dearly\nbeloved Son of God. Lifting the cross cuts away self from the soul,\nand places man where he learns how to bear Christ’s burdens. We\ncan not follow Christ without wearing His yoke, without lifting the\ncross and bearing it after Him. If our will is not in accord with the\ndivine requirements, we are to deny our inclinations, give up our\ndarling desires, and step in Christ’s footsteps....\nMenframefortheirownnecksyokesthatseemlightandpleasant\nto wear, but they prove galling in the extreme. Christ sees this, and\nHe says, Take My yoke upon you. The yoke you would place upon\nyour own neck, thinking it a precise fit, will not fit at all. Take My\nyoke upon you, and learn of Me the lessons essential for you to\nlearn; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto\nyour souls. My yoke is easy, and My burden is light. The Lord never\nmakes a false estimate concerning His heritage. He measures the\nmenwithwhomHeisworking. WhentheysubmittoHisyoke, when\nthey give up the struggle that has been unprofitable for themselves\nand for the cause of God, they will find peace and rest. When they\nbecome sensible of their own weakness, their own deficiencies, they\nwill delight to do God’s will. They will submit to the yoke of Christ.\nThen God can work in them to will and to do of His good pleasure,\nwhich is often entirely contrary to the plans of the human mind.\nWhen the heavenly anointing comes to us, we shall learn the lesson\nof meekness and lowliness, which always brings rest to the soul.6\nAlthough you will have trials, yet these trials, well borne, only\nmake the way more precious.7"

You will hear men exalting human beings, extolling those\nwho are called great by this world. In doing this, they lose sight of\nChrist in the Word. He is not to them all and in all,—the first, the\nlast, the best, in everything. These need to sit at the feet of Jesus,\nand learn of Him whom to know aright is life eternal.10\nThe Bible is our guide in the safe paths that lead to eternal life.\nGod has inspired men to write that which will present the truth to us,\nwhich will attract, and which, if practised, will enable the receiver\nto obtain moral power to rank among the most highly educated\nminds. The minds of all who make the Word of God their study\nwill enlarge.

        "content": "When you present your petitions to the Lord, it should be in\nhumility, without boasting of superior attainments, but with real\nsoul hunger for the blessing of God. Christ always knows what is\ncherished in the heart. We must come in faith that the Lord will\nhear and answer our prayers; for “whatsoever is not of faith is sin.”\nGenuine faith is the faith that works by love, and purifies the soul. A\nliving faithwillbe a working faith. Shouldwe go into the garden and\nfind that there was no sap in the plants, no freshness in the leaves,\nno bursting buds or blooming flowers, no signs of life in stalk or\nbranches, we would say, “The plants are dead. Uproot them from\nthe garden; for they are a deformity to the beds.” So it is with those\nwho profess Christianity, and have no spirituality. If there are no\nsigns of religious vigor, if there is no doing of the commandments\nof the Lord, it is evident that there is no abiding in Christ, the living\nvine.12\nFaith and love are the essential, powerful, working elements of\nChristian character. Those who possess them are one with Christ,\nand are carrying forward His mission.... We are to sit at Christ’s feet\nas continual learners, and to work with His gifts of faith and love.\nWe shall then wear Christ’s yoke, and lift His burdens, and Christ\nwill recognize us as one with Him; in heaven it will be said, “Ye are\nlabourers together with God.” Will our youth remember that without\nfaith it is impossible to please God? and it must be faith that works\nby love and purifies the soul.13\nWe cannot overestimate the value of simple faith and unques-\ntioning obedience. It is by following in the path of obedience in\nsimple faith that the character obtains perfection.14\n[72] We Learn to Speak the Language of Canaan, March\nMy doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the\ndew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the\nshowers upon the grass. Deuteronomy 32:2.\nWe are to be witnesses for Christ; and this we shall be when we\ngrow up daily into the full stature of men and women in Christ. It is\nour privilege to grow more and more like Him every day. Then we\nshall acquire the power to express our love for Him in higher, purer\nspeech, and our ideas will enlarge and deepen, and our judgment\nbecome more sound and trustworthy, while our testimony will have\nmore of life and assurance. We are not to cultivate the language of\nthe earthy, and be so familiar with the conversation of men, that the\nlanguage of Canaan will be new and unfamiliar to us. We are to\nlearn in the school of Christ; yet it is manifest that many are satisfied\nwith very limited experience in spiritual things, for they reveal but\nlittle knowledge of spiritual things in their prayers and testimonies.\nThere is less good judgment manifested in matters concerning our\neternal interests, than in matters concerning our earthly, temporal\naffairs.\nChristians are to be faithful students in the school of Christ, ever\nlearning more of heaven, more of the words and will of God; more\nof the truth and how to use faithfully the knowledge that they have\ngained.15\nThe chief requisite of language is that it be pure and kind and\ntrue—“the outward expression of an inward grace.” ... The best\nschool for this language study is the home.\nKind words are as dew and gentle showers to the soul. The\nScripture says of Christ that grace was poured into His lips, that He\nmight “know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary.”\nAnd the Lord bids us, “Let your speech be alway with grace,” “that\nWeLearntoSpeaktheLanguageofCanaan,March6 109\nit may minister grace unto the hearers.”16 When the heart is pure,\nrich treasure of wisdom will flow forth.17\n[73] We Learn to Beware of Vain Deceit and Flattery,\nBeware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain\ndeceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the\nworld, and not after Christ. Colossians 2:8.\nFlattery is an art by which Satan lieth in wait to deceive and to\npuffupthehumanagentwithhighthoughtsofhimself.... Flatteryhas\nbeen the food upon which many of our youth have been nourished;\nand those who have praised and flattered have supposed that they\nwere doing right; but they have been doing wrong. Praise, flattery,\nand indulgence have done more toward leading precious souls into\nfalse paths, than any other art that Satan has devised. Flattery is a\npart of the world’s policy, but it is no part of Christ’s policy. Through\nflattery poor human beings, full of frailty and infirmities, come to\nthink that they are efficient and worthy, and become puffed up in\ntheir fleshly mind. They become intoxicated with the idea that\nthey possess ability beyond what they do have, and their religious\nexperience becomes unbalanced. Unless in the providence of God\nthey shall be turned from these deceptions, and become converted,\nand learn the a-b-c of religion in the school of Christ, they will lose\ntheir souls. Many a youth has been flattered that he has ability as\na natural gift; when the ability he thinks he has, can be attained\nonly through diligent training and culture, learning the meekness\nand lowliness of Christ.... God permits him to be attacked by the\nenemy, in order that he may understand his own weakness. He is\npermitted to make some decided blunder, and is plunged into painful\nhumiliation. But when he is writhing under a sense of his own\nweakness, he is not to be judged harshly.... This is the time when\nhe needs a friend who ... will deal patiently and faithfully with the\nerring.... He is not to be lifted up by the aid of flattery.... Rather he\nis to be pointed to the first rounds of the ladder, and his stumbling\nfeet are to be placed on the lowest round of the ladder of progress....\nWeLearntoBewareofVainDeceitandFlattery,March7 111\nThrough the aid of wise counselors, his defeat will be turned into\nvictory.18"

They walk in\nnarrow paths on earth; they are purified in the furnace of affliction.\nThey follow Christ through sore conflicts; they endure self-denial,\nand experience bitter disappointments; but their painful experience\nteaches them the guilt and woe of sin, and they look upon it with\nabhorrence. Being partakers of Christ’s sufferings, they are destined\nto be partakers of His glory. In holy vision the prophet saw the\ntriumph of the people of God.

To disprove Satan’s claim is the work of Christ and of\nall who bear His name....\nVery early in the history of the world is given the life-record of\none over whom this controversy of Satan’s was waged. Of Job, the\npatriarch of Uz, the testimony of the Searcher of hearts was, “There\nis none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that\nfeareth God, and escheweth evil.”\nAgainst this man, Satan brought scornful charge: “Doth Job fear\nGod for naught? Hast thou not made a hedge about him, and about\nhis house, and about all that he hath on every side?” ...\nThe Lord said unto Satan, “All that he hath is in thy power.”\n“Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.”\nThuspermitted,SatansweptawayallthatJobpossessed,—flocks\nand herds, men-servants and maidens, sons and daughters; and he\n“smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.”\nStill another element of bitterness was added to his cup.

By his patient endurance he vindicated his own\ncharacter, and thus the character of Him whose representative he\nwas.... The Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before....

ThedaysofdarknessspentinsolitudeatDamascus\nwere as years in his experience. The OldTestamentScriptures stored\nin his memory were his study, and Christ his teacher. To him also\nnature’s solitudes became a school. To the desert of Arabia he went,\nthere to study the Scriptures and to learn of God. He emptied his\nsoul of the prejudices and traditions that had shaped his life, and\nreceived instruction from the Source of truth.\nHis after-life was inspired by the one principle of self-sacrifice,\nthe ministry of love. “I am debtor,” he said, “both to the Greeks, and\nto the barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.” ...\nWhile he possessed high intellectual endowments, the life of\nPaul revealed the power of a rarer wisdom.

It is too much trouble to break up his\nold ways, and transform his ideas and methods. “His taste remained\nin him.” He clings to his defects.77\nThere are many who are not satisfied with the work that God has\ngiven them.

I\nwould that all the young could understand how precious is the offer-\ning of a youthful heart to God. How lovingly the angels guard the\nsteps of God-fearing, God-loving youth.

The youth\nwho has hidden within the heart and mind a store of God’s words of\ncaution and encouragement, of His precious pearls of promise, from\nwhich he can draw at any time, will be a living channel of light.3\nDiligent Heart Keeping Essential to Growth in [99]\nKeep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of\nlife. Proverbs 4:23.\nDiligent heart-keeping is essential to a healthy growth in grace.\nThe heart in its natural state is a habitation for unholy thoughts and\nsinful passions. When brought into subjection to Christ, it must be\ncleansed by the Spirit from all defilement. This can not be done\nwithout the consent of the individual.\nWhen the soul has been cleansed, it is the duty of the Christian\nto keep it undefiled. Many seem to think that the religion of Christ\ndoes not call for the abandonment of daily sins, the breaking loose\nfrom habits which have held the soul in bondage. They renounce\nsome things condemned by the conscience, but they fail to represent\nChrist in the daily life. They do not bring Christlikeness into the\nhome. They do not show a thoughtful care in their choice of words.\nToo often, fretful, impatient words are spoken, words which stir\nthe worst passions of the human heart. Such ones need the abiding\npresence of Christ in the soul. Only in His strength can they keep\nguard over the words and actions. In the work of heart-keeping we\nmust be instant in prayer, unwearied in petitioning the throne of\ngrace for assistance. Those who take the name of Christian should\ncome to God in earnestness and humility, pleading for help. The\nSaviour has told us to pray without ceasing. The Christian can not\nalways be in the position of prayer, but his thoughts and desires can\nalways be upward. Our self-confidence would vanish, did we talk\nless and pray more.4\nThe affections should center upon God. Contemplate His great-\nness, His mercy and excellences. Let His goodness and love and\nperfection of character captivate your heart.5\nThe Saviour of the world loves to have children and youth give\ntheir hearts to Him.6"

        "content": "Jesus says, “Love one another as I have loved you.” Love is not\nsimply an impulse, a transitory emotion, dependent upon circum-\nstances; it is a living principle, a permanent power. The soul is fed\nby the streams of pure love that flow from the heart of Christ, as a\nwell-spring that never fails. O, how is the heart quickened, how are\nits motives ennobled, its affections deepened, by this communion!\nUnder the education and discipline of the Holy Spirit, the children of\nGod love one another, truly, sincerely, unaffectedly,—“without par-\ntiality, and without hypocrisy.” And this because the heart is in love\nwith Jesus. Our affection for one another springs from our common\nrelation to God. We are one family, we love one another as He loved\nus. When compared with this true, sanctified, disciplined affection,\nthe shallow courtesy of the world, the meaningless expression of\neffusive friendship, are as chaff to the wheat.10\nTo love as Christ loved means to manifest unselfishness at all\ntimes and in all places, by kind words and pleasant looks.... Genuine\nlove is a precious attribute of heavenly origin, which increases its\nfragrance in proportion as it is dispensed to others....\nChrist’s love is deep and earnest, flowing like an irrepressible\nstream to all who will accept it. There is no selfishness in His\nlove. If this heaven-born love is an abiding principle in the heart,\nit will make itself known, not only to those we hold most dear in\nsacred relationship, but to all with whom we come in contact. It\nwill lead us to bestow little acts of attention, to make concessions,\nto perform deeds of kindness, to speak tender, true, encouraging\nwords. It will lead us to sympathize with those whose hearts hunger\nfor sympathy.11\nThe Renewed Heart Bringeth Forth Good Things, [102]\nA good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth\nforth good things. Matthew 12:35.\nTrue sanctification unites believers to Christ and to one another\nin bonds of tender sympathy. This union causes to flow continually\ninto the heartrichcurrents ofChristlike love, whichflows forthagain\nin love for one another.\nThe qualities which it is essential for all to possess are those\nwhich marked the completeness of Christ’s character,—His love,\nHis patience, His unselfishness, and His goodness. These attributes\nare gained by doing kindly actions with a kindly heart.... Christians\nlove those around them as precious souls for whom Christ has died.\nThere is no such thing as a loveless Christian; for “God is love.” ...\n“This is my commandment, That ye love one another as I have loved\nyou.” This is the fruit that is to be given back to God.12\nThe Lord will help every one of us where we need help the\nmost in the grand work of overcoming and conquering self. Let\nthe law of kindness be upon your lips and the oil of grace in your\nheart. This will produce wonderful results. You will be tender,\nsympathetic, courteous. You need all these graces. The Holy Spirit\nmust be received and brought into your character; then it will be\nas holy fire, giving forth incense which will rise up to God, not\nfrom lips that condemn, but as a healer of the souls of men. Your\ncountenance will express the image of the divine.... God requires\nevery soul in His service to kindle their censers from the coals of\nsacred fire. The common, severe, harsh words that come from your\nlips so readily must be withheld, and the Spirit of God speak through\nthe human agent. By beholding the character of Christ you will\nbecome changed into His likeness. The grace of Christ alone can\nchange your heart and then you will reflect the image of the Lord\n150 SonsandDaughtersofGod\nJesus. God calls upon us to be like Him,—pure, holy, and undefiled.\nWe are to bear the divine image.13"

The soul\nmust be kept from every stain, through faith in Him who is able\nto keep you from falling. We should meditate upon the Scriptures,\nthinking soberly and candidly upon the things that pertain to our\neternal salvation. The infinite mercy and love of Jesus, the sacrifice\nmade in our behalf, call for most serious and solemn reflection. We\nshould dwell upon the character of our dear Redeemer and Inter-\ncessor. We should seek to comprehend the meaning of the plan of\nsalvation. We should meditate upon the mission of Him who came\nto save His people from their sins. By constantly contemplating\nheavenly themes, our faith and love will grow stronger. Our prayers\nwill be more and more acceptable to God, because they will be more\nand more mixed with faith and love.

Psalm 8:3, 4.\nGod encourages us to contemplate His works in the natural\nworld. He desires that we shall turn our minds from the study of\nthe artificial to the natural. We shall understand this better as we lift\nup our eyes to the hills of God, and contemplate the works which\nHis own hands have created. His hand has molded the hills, and\nbalanced them in their position, that they shall not be moved except\nat His command. The wind, the sun, the rain, the snow, and the ice\nare all ministers to do His will.\nBy the Christian, God’s love and benevolence can be seen in\nevery gift from His hands. The beauties of nature are a theme for\ncontemplation. In studying the natural loveliness surrounding us, the\nmind is carried up through nature to the Author of all that is lovely.\nAll the works of God are speaking to our senses, magnifying His\npower, exalting His wisdom. Every created thing has in it charms\nwhich interest the child of God, and mold his taste to regard these\nprecious evidences of God’s love above the work of human skill.\nIn words of glowing fervor, the prophet magnifies God in His\ncreated works: “When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy\nfingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained: what is\nman, that thou art mindful of him?”33\nThe world, filled with sport and pleasure-loving, is always thirst-\ning for some new interest. And how little time and thought are given\nto the Creator of the heavens and the earth. God calls upon His\ncreatures to turn their attention from the confusion and perplexity\naround them, and admire His handiwork. The heavenly bodies are\nworthy of contemplation. God has made them for the benefit of man,\n162 SonsandDaughtersofGod\nand as we study His works, angels of God will be by our side to\nenlighten our minds.34"

The poor, the\nafflicted and distressed, followed after Him, to receive the help and\ncomfort which they could not find elsewhere. Blind Bartimeus is\nwaiting by the wayside; he has waited long to meet Christ.\nThrongs of people who possess their sight are passing to and\nfro, but they have no desire to see Jesus. One look of faith would\ntouch His heart of love, and bring them the blessings of His grace;\nbut they know not the sickness and poverty of their souls, and they\nfeel no need of Christ. Not so with the poor blind man. His only\nhope is in Jesus. As he waits and watches, he hears the tread of\nmany feet, and he eagerly inquires, What means this noise of travel?\nThe by-standers answer that “Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.” With\nthe eagerness of intense desire, he cries, “Jesus, thou Son of David,\nhave mercy on me!” They try to silence him, but he cries the more\nvehemently, “Thou Son of David, have mercy on me!” This appeal is\nheard. His persevering faith is rewarded. Not only is physical sight\nrestored, but the eyes of his understanding are opened. In Christ\nhe sees his Redeemer, and the Sun of Righteousness shines into his\nsoul. All who feel their need of Christ as did blind Bartimeus, and\nwho will be as earnest and determined as he was, will, like him,\nreceive the blessing which they crave.\nThe afflicted, suffering ones who sought Christ as their helper,\nwere charmed with the divine perfection, the beauty of holiness, that\nshone forth in His character.71\n182 SonsandDaughtersofGod\nThose who receive Christ by faith will receive also power to\nbecome the sons of God.72"

It was He who gave him the victory, and He changed his\nname from Jacob to Israel, saying, “As a prince hast thou power with\nGod and with men, and hast prevailed.” That for which Jacob had\nvainly wrestled in his own strength, was won through self-surrender\nand steadfast faith.75\n184 SonsandDaughtersofGod\nMay—We Follow the Perfect Pattern"

He was filled with divine wisdom, and\nthrough the study of nature, and by meditation upon the communion\nwith God, His spiritual powers were strengthened.25\nThe Redeemer of the world passed up and down the hills and\nmountains, from the great plain to the mountain valley. He enjoyed\nnature’s beautiful scenery. He was delighted with the fields glowing\nwith the beautiful flowers, and in listening to the birds of the air, and\nuniting His voice with them in their happy songs of praise.26\nIn the life of Christ, His childhood and youth, there is a lesson\nfor the youth of today. Christ is our example, and in youth we should\ncontemplate God in nature,—study His character in the work of\nHis hands. The mind is strengthened by becoming acquainted with\nGod, by reading His attributes in the things which He has made.\nAs we behold the beauty and grandeur in the works of nature, our\naffections go out after God; and ... our souls are invigorated by\ncoming in contact with the Infinite through His marvelous works.27"

Good works will\nbe revealed in every true believer. The Lord can accept of nothing\nshort of perfection of character, wholeness to God. Any half-hearted\nservice will testify before the heavenly intelligences that you have\nfailed to copy the Pattern.35\nChrist’s followers are to be more than a light in the midst of men.\nThey are the light of the world. Jesus says to all who have named\nHis name, You have given yourselves to Me, and I have given you\nto the world as My representatives. As the Father had sent Him into\nthe world, so He declares, “have I also sent them into the world.” ...\nWhile our Saviour is the great source of illumination, forget not, O\nChristian, that He is revealed through humanity. God’s blessings are\nbestowed through human instrumentality.... Angels of glory wait to\ncommunicate through you heaven’s light and power to souls that are\nready to perish.... If Christ is dwelling in the heart, it is impossible\nto conceal the light of His presence.36\nWhen the Light of the world passes by, privileges appear in all\nhardships, order in confusion, the success and wisdom of God in\nthat which has seemed to be failure.37\nThe gifts of light and life come to us together.38\nIn Demonstrating God’s Parental Attributes, May [139]\nLike as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them\nthat fear him. Psalm 103:13.\nIn all the gracious deeds that Jesus did, He sought to impress\nupon men the parental, benevolent attributes of God. In all His\nlessons He was seeking to teach men the wonderful truth that “God\nso loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoso-\never believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”\nJesus would have us understand the love of the Father, and He seeks\nto draw us to Him by presenting His parental grace. He would have\nthe whole field of our vision filled with the perfection of God’s char-\nacter. In His prayer for His disciples He says, “I have glorified thee\non the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. I\nhave manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out\nof the world.”\nJesus came into the world to illustrate the character of God in\nHis own life, and He swept back the misrepresentations that Satan\nhad originated, and revealed the glory of God. It was only by living\namong men that He could reveal the mercy, compassion, and love of\nHis heavenly Father; for it was only by actions of benevolence that\nHe could set forth the grace of God. The unbelief of men was deep\nseated, and yet they could not resist the testimony of His God-like\nexample, and His deeds of love and truth.39\nThe bounties of God’s providence speak to every soul, confirm-\ning Christ’s testimony to the supreme goodness of His Father. The\nLord would have His people realize that the blessings bestowed\nupon any object of creation are proportionate to the place that object\noccupies in the scale of creation. If even the wants of dumb animals\nare supplied, can we appreciate the blessings which God will bestow\nupon the beings formed in His image?40\n198 SonsandDaughtersofGod\nGod is love, and He cares for us. “Like as a father pitieth his\nchildren, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.”41"

Matthew 4:3, 4.\nThe great trial of Christ in the wilderness on the point of appetite\nwas to leave man an example of self-denial.

The victory which Christ gained in the wilderness was to\nshow man the sinfulness of the very things in which he takes such\npleasure.

Their\nminds would have been called away from themselves to the blessed\nSaviour. They would have been taught to feel that He loved them,\nand that He is the source of all blessing; that He is their hope of\nhappiness and eternal life.\nIf this kind of education had been given to our children, we\nshould today see far less selfishness, far less envy and jealousy; we\nshould have more manly young men and womanly young women.\nWe should see the youth coming up with moral strength, with pure\nprinciples, with well-balanced minds and lovely characters, because\nthe Model would be ever before them; they would be impressed with\nthe importance of copying the excellence of Jesus, the Pattern....\nGod wants the youth and those of mature age to look to Him, to\nbelieve in Jesus Christ whom He has sent, and to have Him abiding\nin the heart; then a new life will quicken every faculty of the being.\nThe divine Comforter will be with them, to strengthen them in their\n214 SonsandDaughtersofGod\nweakness, and guide them in their perplexity....

Through Christ\nJustice is enabled to forgive without sacrificing one jot of its exalted\nholiness.72\nChrist taught us to pray, “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our\ndebtors,” and added, “For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your\nheavenly Father will also forgive your trespasses.” ...\nWill you not, if any one has done you a wrong, and is too proud\nand stubborn to say to you, “I repent,” go to the offender and say,\n“I love you for Christ’s sake, and I forgive you the injury you have\ndone me”? Jesus will witness and approve of this deed of love; and\nas you do to others, it shall be done again to you.73\nWe are to have a spirit of pity, of compassion toward those\nwho have trespassed against us, whether or not they confess their\nfaults.

Judas pressed next to Christ on the left\nside; John was on the right. If there was a highest place, Judas\nwas determined to have it, and that place was thought to be next to\nChrist....\nAnother cause of dissension had arisen. At a feast it was cus-\ntomary for a servant to wash the feet of the guests.... The pitcher, the\nbasin, and the towel were there, in readiness for the feet washing;\nbut no servant was present, and it was the disciples’ part to perform\nit....

Laying aside the outer garment\nthat would have impeded His movements, He took a towel, and\ngirded Himself.... “After that he poureth water into a basin, and\nbegan to wash the disciples’ feet.” ...

As He ate the Passover\nwith His disciples, He instituted in its place the service that was to\nbe the memorial of His great sacrifice. The national festival of the\nJews was to pass away forever. The service which Christ established\nwas to be observed by His followers in all lands and through all\nages.... Till He shall come the second time in power and glory, this\nordinance is to be celebrated.90\nIt is at these, His own appointments, that Christ meets His peo-\nple, and energizes them by His presence.... All who come with\ntheir faith fixed upon Him will be greatly blessed. All who neglect\nthese seasons of divine privilege will suffer loss. Of them it may\nappropriately be said, “Ye are not all clean.” ...\nBut the Communion service was not to be a season of sorrowing.\nThis was not its purpose.... They are not to recall the differences\nbetween them and their brethren. The preparatory service has em-\nbraced all this.... Now they come to meet with Christ.

The company\nthey keep, the principles they adopt, the habits they form, willdecide\nthe question of their usefulness here, and of their future, eternal\ninterest....\nThrough contact with the irreligious, the pleasure-loving, and\nthe corrupt, many, many youth lose the simplicity and purity, the\nfaith in God, and the spirit of self-sacrifice that Christian fathers\nand mothers have cherished and guarded by careful instruction and\nearnest prayer....\nAs a rule, men and women who have broad ideas, unselfish pur-\nposes, noble aspirations, are those in whom these characteristics\nwere developed by their associations in early years. In all His deal-\nings with Israel, God urged upon them the importance of guarding\nthe associations of their children. All the arrangements of civil,\nreligious, and social life were made with a view to preserving the\nchildren from harmful companionship, and making them, from their\nearliest years, familiar with the precepts and principles of the law\nof God. The object-lesson given at the birth of the nation was of a\nnature deeply to impress all hearts. Before the last terrible judgment\ncame upon the Egyptians in the death of the first-born, God com-\nmanded His people to gather their children into their own homes.\nThe doorpost of every house was marked with blood, and within the\nprotection assured by this token all were to abide. So today parents\nwho love and fear God are to keep their children under “the bond\nof the covenant,”—within the protection of those sacred influences\nmade possible through Christ’s redeeming blood.11\nWe Do Not Consent to Enticement of Sinners, June [164]\nMy son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.... For their feet\nrun to evil, and make haste to shed blood. Proverbs 1:10, 16.\nIt is not safe for the professed follower of Christ to associate\nwith the careless and reckless; for it is an easy matter to come to\nview things as they do, and to lose all sense of what it means to be a\nfollowerofJesus. Guardyourselfon thisone pointin particular,—do\nnot be influenced and led astray by those you have reason to know,\nby their words and works, are not in connection with God.12\nHear the voice of God: “My son, if sinners entice thee, consent\nthou not.” Those who are controlled by the Spirit of God are to\nkeep their perceptive faculties awake; for the time has come when\ntheir integrity and loyalty to God and to one another will be tested.\nDo not commit the least injustice in order to gain an advantage for\nyourselves. Do unto others, in small matters as well as in great, as\nyou would that others should do unto you. God says, “Ye are my\nwitnesses.” You are to act in My place. Could the curtain be rolled\nback, you would see the heavenly universe looking with intense\ninterest upon the one who is tempted. If you do not yield to the\nenemy, there is joy in heaven. When the first suggestion of wrong is\nheard, dart a prayer to heaven, and then firmly resist the temptation\nto tamper with the principles condemned in God’s Word. The first\ntime the temptation comes, meet it in such a decided manner that\nit will never be repeated. Turn from the one who has ventured to\npresent wrong practises to you. Resolutely turn from the tempter,\nsaying, I must separate from your influence; for I know you are not\nwalking in the footsteps of our Saviour.\nEven though you may not feel able to speak a word to those who\nare working on wrong principles, leave them. Your withdrawal and\nsilence may do more than words.... Have courage to do right.13\n[165] We Choose a Life Companion Who Loves God,"

One of the greatest dangers that besets the people of\nGod today, is that of association with the ungodly; especially in\nuniting themselves in marriage with unbelievers. With many, the\nlove for the human eclipses the love for the divine. They take the\nfirst step in backsliding by venturing to disregard the Lord’s express\ncommand; and complete apostasy is too often the result. It has ever\nproved a dangerous thing for men to carry out their own will in\nopposition to the requirements of God. Yet it is a hard lesson for\nmen to learn that God means what He says. As a rule, those who\nchoose for their friends and companions, persons who reject Christ\nand trample upon God’s law, eventually become of the same mind\nand spirit.14\nIf we would rise to the highest moral excellence, and attain to\nthe perfection of religious character, what discrimination should be\nused in the formation of friendships, and the choice of a companion\nfor life....\nMany who started out in life with as fair and promising a morn-\ning, in their limited sphere, as Solomon had in his exalted station,\nthrough one false and irrevocable step in the marriage relation, lose\ntheir souls, and draw others down to ruin with them.... Frivolous\ncompanions, who have no depth of principle, turn away the hearts of\nthose who were once noble and true, to vanity, corrupting pleasures,\nand downright vice.15\nWe should ever feel a deep interest in the salvation of the im-\npenitent, and should manifest toward them a spirit of kindness and\ncourtesy; but we can safely choose for our friends only those who\nare the friends of God.16"

As\nan earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise re-\nprover upon an obedient ear.” When we can associate together to\nhelp one another heavenward, when the conversation is upon divine\nand heavenly things, then it amounts to something to talk; but when\nthe conversation centers upon self and upon earthly and unimportant\nmatters, silence is golden. The obedient ear will receive reproof\nwith humility, patience, and teachableness. Then only do our com-\nmunications with each other prove beneficial, and fulfil all that God\nwould have them. When both sides of the divine instruction are\nfulfilled, the wise reprover does his duty, and the obedient ear hears\nto a purpose and is benefited.17\nEvery association we form, however limited, exerts some in-\nfluence upon us. The extent to which we yield to that influence\nwill be determined by the degree of intimacy, the constancy of the\nintercourse, and our love and veneration for the one with whom we\nassociate.18\nYour good will, your unselfish acts, will not be to a favored few,\nbut to all with whom you associate. Thus you will form friends\nand attachments that are dear and lasting; your own deeds will be\nreflected back on yourself.19\nThrough the social relations, Christianity comes in contact with\nthe world. Every one who has received the divine illumination is to\nbrighten the pathway of those who know not the Light of Life.20\n[167] Jesus is a Friend That is Closer Than a Brother,"

The arch fiend\nwell knows with what material he has to deal; and he has displayed\nhis infernal wisdom in devising customs and pleasures for the youth\nwhich will separate their affections from Jesus Christ. The various\namusements of society have been the ruin of thousands and tens of\nthousands who, had it not been for these attractions, would have\nbeen obedient children, respectful to their parents, upright, pure, and\nnoble in their pursuits and in their character.60\nShould Christ come among the assembly who were absorbed in\ntheir plays and frivolous amusements, would the solemn melody of\nHis voice be heard in benediction, saying, “Peace be to this house”?\nHow would the Saviour of the world enjoy these scenes of gaiety\nand folly?61\nPride and ambition are never satisfied, but those who are truly\nwise will find substantial and elevating pleasure in the sources of\nenjoyment that God placed within the reach of all.62\nIt is the privilege and duty of Christians to seek to refresh their\nspirits and invigorate their bodies by innocent recreation, with the\npurpose of using their physical and mental powers to the glory\nof God.

        "content": "The Lord Jesus came to our world full of mercy, life, and light,\nready to save those who should come unto Him. But He can save\nno one against his will. God does not force the conscience; He does\nnot torture the body that He may compel men to compliance with\nHis law. All this work is after the order of Satan....\nThe Lord has made it apparent that He proffers to the sinner the\nprivilege of cooperating with God. He gives light, and furnishes\nevidence of the truth. He makes plain what are His requirements,\nand it is left with the sinner as to whether he will accept the truth,\nand receive grace and power by which he may comply with every\ncondition, and find rest in giving willing service to Jesus Christ, who\nhas paid the price of his redemption. If the sinner hesitates, and fails\nto appreciate the light that has reached his intellect and stirred the\nemotions of his soul, and refuses to render obedience to God, the\nlight grows dim, has less and less force, and finally vanishes from\nhis view. Those who fail to appreciate the first rays of light, will\nnot heed more decided evidences of the truth. If the tender appeals\nof God fail to meet with a response in the heart of the sinner, the\nfirst impressions made upon his mind lose their significance, and\nhe is finally left in darkness. The invitation is full of love. The\nlight is as bright when he finally refuses it, as when it first dawned\nupon his soul; but through rejection of light, his soul becomes full\nof darkness, and does not realize what is the peril of disregarding\nthe light. Christ says to such a soul, “Yet a little while is the light\nwith you.”81\nToday make your calling and election sure. Peter gives a copy\nof the best life insurance policy in the world. He says: “Grace and\npeace be multiplied unto you ... according as his divine power hath\ngiven unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness.”82"

The human\nambition has been seeking for that kind of knowledge that will bring\nto them glory and self-exaltation and supremacy. Thus Adam and\nEve were worked upon by Satan until God’s restraint was snapped\nasunder, and their education under the teacher of lies began in order\nthat they might have the knowledge which God had refused them.83\nTrue wisdom is a treasure as lasting as eternity.

But they\nbecame selfish and discontented, and in order that they might not\nforget His great care over them, the Lord gave them a bitter lesson.\nHe permitted them to be bitten by the fiery serpents, yet in His\ngreat mercy He did not leave them to perish. Moses was bidden to\nlift the brazen serpent on the pole, and make the proclamation that\nwhosoever should look upon it should live. And all who looked,\ndid live. They recovered health at once.... What a strange symbol\nof Christ was that likeness of the serpents which stung them. This\nsymbol was lifted on a pole, and they were to look to it, and be\nhealed. So Jesus was made in the likeness of sinful flesh. He came\nas the sin-bearer....\nThe same healing, life-giving message is now sounding. Itpoints\nto the uplifted Saviour upon the shameful tree.

He who has felt the power of\nthe grace of Christ has a story to tell. He seeks to put in operation\nmethods of work which will diffuse the gospel of Christ. Humanity,\ndrawing its efficiency from the great source of wisdom, is made\nthe instrumentality, the working agency, through which the gospel\nexercises its transforming power on mind and heart....\nAll our powers are to be used for Christ. This is the debt we\neach owe to God. In forming a relationship with Christ the renewed\nman is but coming back to his appointed relationship with God....\nHis duties lie round him, nigh and afar off. His first duty is to his\nchildren and his nearest relatives.

Mutual\nlove binds heart to heart, and the unity that exists among the mem-\nbers of the family preaches the most effectual sermon that could\nbe preached on practical godliness. As parents faithfully do their\nduty in the family, restraining, correcting, advising, counseling,\nguiding,—the father as a priest of the household, the mother as a\nhome missionary,—they are filling the sphere God would have them\nfill. By faithfully doing their duty in the home, they are multiplying\nagencies for doing good outside the home. They are becoming better\nfitted to labor in the church. By training their little flock discreetly,\nbinding their children to themselves and to God, fathers and mothers\nbecome laborers together with God. The cross is erected in their\n302 SonsandDaughtersofGod\nhome. The members of the family become members of the royal\nfamily above, children of the heavenly King.8\nWe are Redeemed by Christ’s Precious Blood, [224]\nForasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with\ncorruptible things, as silver and gold, ... but with the precious\nblood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.\n1 Peter 1:18, 19.\nEvery soul is precious, because it has been purchased by the\nprecious blood of Jesus Christ.9\nSatanmaywhisper,“YouaretoogreatasinnerforChristtosave.”\nWhile you acknowledge that you are indeed sinful and unworthy,\nyou may meet the tempter with the cry, “By virtue of the atonement,\nI claim Christ as my Saviour. I trust not to my own merits, but to the\nprecious blood of Jesus, which cleanses me.”10\nYou cannot save yourself from the tempter’s power, but he trem-\nbles and flees when the merits of that precious blood are urged.11\nThe Lord loves you; He is dearer to you than any earthly tie,\nthan any earthly object. Consider how preciously near you may keep\nto One who is your strength and efficiency. Live not in the shadow\nof the cross, but on the sunny side of the cross, where the Sun of\nrighteousness may shine into your heart.12\nWe are to have free access to the atoning blood of Christ.

Through Moses, Christ gave\ndefinite directions to the children of Israel in regard to the sacrificial\nofferings....

In the afternoon He\ndied. This was the hour of the evening sacrifice. Then the veil of the\ntemple, thatwhichhidGod’sgloryfromtheviewofthecongregation\nof Israel, was rent in twain from top to bottom.\nThrough Christ the hidden glory of the holy of holies was to\nstand revealed. He had suffered death for every man, and by this\noffering, the sons of men were to become the sons of God. With\nopen face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, believers\nin Christ were to be changed into the same image, from glory to\nglory. The mercy seat, upon which the glory of God rested in the\nholiest of all, is opened to all who accept Christ as the propitiation\nfor sin, and through its medium, they are brought into fellowship\nwith God. The veil is rent, the partition walls broken down, the\nhandwriting of ordinances cancelled. By virtue of His blood the\nenmity is abolished.19\nThe simple story of the cross of Christ, His suffering and dying\nfor the world, His resurrection and ascension, His mediation in the\nsinner’s behalf before the Father, subdues and breaks the hard and\nsinful heart, and brings the sinner to repentance. The Holy Spirit\nsets the matter before him in a new light, and the sinner realizes that\nsin must be a tremendous evil to cost such a sacrifice to atone for\nit.... How grievous must sin be that no less a remedy than the death\nof the Son of God could save man from the consequences of his\nguilt. Why was this done in behalf of man?—It was because God\nloved him, and was not willing that any should perish, but that all\n310 SonsandDaughtersofGod\nshould come to repentance, believe in Jesus as a personal Saviour,\nand have life eternal.20\nWe Are Reconciled to God by Christ’s Death, [229]\nFor if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by\nthe death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be\nsaved by his life. Romans 5:10.\nThe cross is invested with a power that language cannot express.\nChrist’s sacrifice in behalf of the human race puts to shame our\nmeager efforts and methods to meet and uplift humanity, to help\nsinful men and women to find Jesus.\nThe work of the sons and daughters of God must be of a differ-\nent character than has yet been manifested by a large number. If\nthey love Jesus, they will have enlarged ideas of the love that has\nbeen expressed for fallen man, which required the provision of so\nexpensive an offering to save the human race. Our Saviour asks the\ncooperation of every son and daughter of Adam who has become\na son or daughter of God.... Our Saviour declares that He brought\nfrom heaven as a donation eternal life. He was to be lifted up upon\nthe cross of Calvary to draw all men unto Him. How then shall we\ntreat the purchased inheritance of Christ? Tenderness, appreciation,\nkindness, sympathy, and love should be shown to them. Then we\nmay work to help and bless one another. In this work we have more\nthan human brotherhood. We have the exalted companionship of\nheavenly angels. They cooperate with us in the work of enlightening\nhigh and low.\nHaving engaged in the work, the amazing work of our redemp-\ntion, Christ determined in council with His Father to spare nothing,\nhowever costly, to withhold nothing however highly it might be esti-\nmated, that would rescue the poor sinner. He would give all heaven\nto this work of salvation, of restoring the moral image of God in\nman.... To be a child of God is to be one with Christ in God, and to\nput forth our hands in earnest, self-sacrificing love to strengthen and\nbless the souls that are perishing in their sins.21\n[230] Christ Has Delivered Us from Eternal Death,\nWho delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in\nwhom we trust that he will yet deliver us. 2 Corinthians 1:10.\nOur Saviour came to this world to endure in human nature all\nthe temptations wherewith man is beset. In His life He measured\nthe power of the wily foe to deceive, to allure, and to destroy. As\nthe Redeemer of the race, He warns humanity against seeking after\nthose things that will lead away from the narrow path. He has\ncast up a glorious highway for those who are traveling toward the\nheavenly mansions that He has gone to prepare for all who will\nprepare themselves to become members of the royal family....\nWith His life Christ has purchased every human being. He died\na cruel death to save human beings from eternal death. He gave His\nsinless life to obtain for the sinner a life that measures with the life\nof God. Through His death, He provided a way whereby man may\nbreak with Satan, return to his allegiance to God, and through faith\nin the Redeemer obtain pardon....\nHe who has all power in heaven and earth will restore every\nrepenting, believing soul. To as many as receive Him He gives\npower to become the sons of God. He has a deep interest in every\nsoul, for He paid the price of His own life that no one should be\neternally lost.22\nChrist’s servants can and should be able to meet and overcome\nevery temptation. They should say, “I am not my own; I have been\nbought with a price. By the infinite sacrifice Christ has made for me,\nHe has put it out of my power to give Him more than He demands.\nAll is His. He has purchased me, body, soul, and spirit. He calls for\nall my time, all my capabilities.”23\nThose who receive Him and believe in Him become the spiritual\nchildren of God. They are adopted into the royal family, and as they\nseekto do the willofGod, they become conformedinto His image.24"

Unless our youth are sacredly guarded, unless they are\nfortified with firm principles, unless greater care is manifested in\nchoosing their associates and the literature which feeds the mind,\nthey will be exposed to a society whose morals are as corrupt as\nwere the morals of the inhabitants of Sodom.... Our youth will\nmeet temptations on every hand, and they must be so educated that\nthey will depend upon higher power, higher teaching, than can be\ngiven by mortals. There are despisers of our Lord everywhere, who\nhabitually throw contempt upon Christianity....

Jesus, the world’s Redeemer is my Saviour; in Him is\ncentered my hope of eternal life.” But this is the very way in which\nto silence them. If you argue with them, they will have arguments\nwith which to meet you, and nothing you may say will touch them;\nbut if you live for Christ, if you are firm in your allegiance to the\nGod of heaven, you may do for them that which argument will fail\nto do....\nThere is no sadder spectacle than that of those who have been\npurchased by the blood of Christ, who have been intrusted with\ntalents wherewith they may glorify God, turning to jest the messages\ngraciously sent to them in the gospel, denying the divinity of Christ,\nand trusting to their own finite reasoning, and to arguments that have\nno foundation.

The Christian\nis to be joyful in contemplation of that which the Lord has done in\ngiving His only begotten Son to die for the world, “that whosoever\nbelieveth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”\nThose who stand under the blood-stained banner of Prince Im-\nmanuel, should be faithful soldiers in Christ’s army. They should\nnever be disloyal, never be untrue. Many of the young will volunteer\nto stand with Jesus, the Prince of life. But if they would continue to\nstand with Him, they must constantly look unto Jesus, their Captain,\nfor His orders. They cannot be soldiers of Christ and yet engage\nwith the confederacy of Satan, and help along his side, for then they\nwould be enemies of Christ. They would betray sacred trusts.56\nThe cross ... is to be lifted and borne without a murmur or\ncomplaint. In the act of raising it, you will find that it raises you.\nYou will find it alive with mercy, compassion, and pitying love.57\nThrough bearing the cross your experience may be such that you\ncan say, “‘I know that my Redeemer liveth,’ and because He lives, I\nshall live also.” What an assurance is this!58"

They admit that Christ died on the cross, but because\nthere is a crucifixion for them to experience, they will not receive the\nlessons that lead to self-denial and self-sacrifice. They are Christians\nin name only. The central point of their faith is not a crucified and\nrisen Saviour, who brings to all that receive Him the privilege of\nbeing sons and daughters of God.59\nGive up the pleasures of sin in exchange for heaven and eternal\nlife. What are the few days of selfish gratification that contain not\none genuine drop of happiness, to the eternity of bliss that awaits\nthe faithful soul? Keep not Christ’s love from your soul. Look\nto the cross of Calvary if you want a tangible proof of His love.\nHeaven is looking upon you with intense interest, to see what you\nwill do. The angels are amazed when you turn with indifference\nfrom the blessings that are proffered you. If you refuse to respond\nto the drawing love of Christ, you will finally grow rebellious and\ndefiant.60\nPaul realized that his sufficiency was not in himself, but in the\npresence of the Holy Spirit, whose gracious influence filled his heart,\nbringing every thought into subjection to Christ.... In the apostle’s\nteachings, Christ was the central figure. “I live,” he declared, “yet\nnot I, but Christ liveth in me.” Self was hidden; Christ was revealed\nand exalted.61\nThose who deny self to do others good, and who devote them-\nselves and all they have to Christ’s service, will realize the happiness\nwhich the selfish man seeks for in vain.62\n[247] We Take Up Our Cross and Follow Christ, August\nMy sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.\nJohn 10:27.\nHow precious is the knowledge that we have a faithful Friend,\nOne who will impart to us a noble, elevated character, which will fit\nus for the companionship of the heavenly angels in the courts above!\nHis guardianship is over all His children. They have a peace that the\nworld can neither give nor take away. The loss of earthly treasures\ndoes not make them hopeless or homeless....\nChrist beholds the world, full of activity in seeking for earthly\ntreasures. He sees many eagerly trying first one thing and then\nanother in their efforts to obtain the coveted earthly treasure which\nthey think will satisfy their selfish greed, while in their eager pursuit\nthey pass by the only path that leads to the true riches.\nAs One having authority Christ speaks to such ones, inviting\nthem to follow Him. He offers to lead them to the riches that are as\nenduring as eternity. He points them to the narrow pathofself-denial\nand sacrifice. Those who press on in this path, surmounting every\nobstacle, will reach the land of glory. In lifting the cross they find\nthat the cross lifts them, and they will at last gain the imperishable\ntreasure.\nMany think to find security in earthly riches. But Christ seeks to\nremove from their eye the mote that obscures the vision, and thus\nenable them to behold the far more exceeding and eternal weight of\nglory. They are mistaking phantoms for realities, and have lost sight\nof the glories of the eternal world. Christ calls upon them to extend\ntheir view beyond the present, and add eternity to their vision.63\nWe are to lift the cross, and follow the steps of Christ. Those\nwho lift the cross will find that as they do this, the cross lifts them,\ngiving them fortitude and courage, and pointing them to the Lamb\nof God, who taketh away the sin of the world.64\nIf We Shun the Cross, We Lose Eternal Life, August [248]\nHe that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not\nworthy of me. Matthew 10:38.\nThere can be only two classes.... And all who place themselves\non the side of the disloyal are standing under Satan’s black banner,\nand are charged with rejecting and despitefully using Christ. They\nare charged with deliberately crucifying the Lord of life and glory.65\nHe who shuns the cross shuns the reward promised to the faith-\nful.66\nLook to Calvary until your heart melts at the amazing love of\nthe Son of God. He left nothing undone that fallen man might be\nelevated and purified. And shall we not confess Him? Will the reli-\ngion of Christ degrade its receiver?—No; it will be no degradation\nto follow in the footsteps of the Man of Calvary. Day by day let us\nsit at the feet of Jesus, and learn of Him, that in our conversation,\nour conduct, our dress, and in all our affairs, we may reveal the fact\nthat Jesus is ruling and reigning over us. God calls upon us to walk\nin a path that has been cast up for the ransomed of the Lord; we are\nnot to walk in the world. We are to surrender all to God, and confess\nChrist before men....\n“He that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not\nworthy of me. He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth\nhis life for my sake shall find it.” Day by day we are to deny self, to\nlift the cross and follow in the footsteps of the Master....\nI am glad that the day of probation is not closed. Let us in the\nname of Jesus Christ of Nazareth fall on the Rock and be broken.\nBy meekness, by love, by a holy conversation, by a compassionate\nspirit, confess Christ to others. O that we might come into a position\nwhere He might reveal His glory as it was revealed in Jerusalem\nwhen the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the people.67\nThe cross of Calvary is to us the pledge of everlasting life.68"

        "content": "The Saviour’s burden was too heavy for Him in His weak and\nsuffering condition. Since the Passover supper with His disciples,\nHe had taken neither food nor drink. He had agonized in the garden\nof Gethsemane in conflict with satanic agencies.... All through the\ndisgraceful farce of a trial He had borne Himself with firmness and\ndignity. But when after the second scourging the cross was laid upon\nHim, human nature could bear no more. He fell fainting beneath the\nburden.\nThe crowd that followed the Saviour saw His weak and stagger-\ning steps, but they manifested no compassion.... His persecutors saw\nthat it was impossible for Him to carry His burden farther. They\nwere puzzled to find any one who would bear the humiliating load.\nThe Jews themselves could not do this....\nAt this time a stranger, Simon a Cyrenian, coming in from the\ncountry, meets the throng. He hears the taunts and ribaldry of the\ncrowd; he hears the words contemptuously repeated, Make way for\nthe King of the Jews! He stops in astonishment at the scene; and\nas he expressed his compassion, they seize him and place the cross\nupon his shoulders.\nSimon hadheardofJesus. Hissonswerebelieversin theSaviour,\nbuthe himselfwas nota disciple. The bearing ofthe cross to Calvary\nwas a blessing to Simon, and he was ever after grateful for this\nprovidence. It led him to take upon himself the cross of Christ from\nchoice, and ever cheerfully stand beneath its burden.69\nThe cross he [Simon] was forced to bear became the means of\nhis conversion. His sympathies were deeply stirred in favor of Jesus;\nand the events of Calvary, and the words uttered by the Saviour,\ncaused him to acknowledge that He was the Son of God.70\nDying Thief Accepts Christ as His Saviour, August [250]\nAnd he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest\ninto thy kingdom. Luke 23:42.\nTo the last of His work Christ is a sin-pardoner. At deepest\nmidnight, as the Star of Bethlehem was about to sink into oblivion,\nlo there shines amid the moral darkness with distinct brightness the\nfaith of a dying sinner as he lays hold upon a dying Saviour.\nSuch faith may be represented by the eleventh hour laborers who\nreceive as much reward as do those who have labored for many\nhours. The thief asked in faith, in penitence, in contrition. He asked\nin earnestness, as if he fully realized that Jesus could save him if He\nwould. And the hope in his voice was mingled with anguish as he\nrealized, that if He did not, he would be lost, eternally lost. He cast\nhis helpless, dying soul and body on Jesus Christ.71\nHe had heard Pilate declare, “I find no fault in him.” John 19:4.\nHe had marked His godlike bearing, and His pitying forgiveness of\nHis tormentors.... Among the passers-by he hears many defending\nJesus. He hears them repeat His words, and tell of His works. The\nconviction comes ... to him that this is the Christ.... When con-\ndemned for his crime, the thief had become hopeless and despairing;\nbut strange, tender thoughts now spring up. He calls to mind all he\nhas heard of Jesus.... He has heard the words of those who believed\nin Jesus and followed Him weeping.... The Holy Spirit illuminates\nhis mind, and little by little the chain of evidence is joined together.\nIn Jesus, bruised, mocked, and hanging upon the cross, he sees\nthe Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world. Hope is\nmingled with anguish in his voice as the helpless, dying soul casts\nhimself upon a dying Saviour.... Quickly the answer came. Soft and\nmelodious the tone, full of love, compassion, and power the words:\nVerily I say unto thee today, Thou shalt be with Me in Paradise.... To\nthe penitent thief came the perfect peace of acceptance with God.72\n334 SonsandDaughtersofGod\nSeptember—We are Laborers Together\nwith God"

Nothing can excuse him\nfrom neglecting the inner circle for the larger circle outside. In the\nday of final reckoning fathers and mothers ... will be asked what\nthey did and said to secure the salvation of the souls they took upon\nthemselves the responsibility of bringing into the world.

The spiritual welfare of your family comes first.5\nIn rightly training and molding the minds of her children, moth-\ners are entrusted with the greatest mission ever given to mortals.6\nWhenever you take up the duty that lies nearest you, then God\nwill bless you, and hear your prayers. There are too many doing\noutside missionary work, while their own households are left des-\ntitute of any such efforts,—going to ruin through neglect.... The\nfirst missionary work is to see that love, light, and joy come into the\nhome circle. Let us not be looking for some great temperance or\nmissionary work to do until we have first done the duties at home.\nEvery morning we should think, What kind act can I do today? What\ntender word can I speak? Kind words at home are blessed sunshine.\nThe husband needs them, the wife needs them, the children need\nthem.... It ought to be the desire of every heart to make as much\nheaven below as possible.7\nA soul saved in your own family circle or in your own neighbor-\nhood, by your patient, painstaking labor, will bring as much honor\n338 SonsandDaughtersofGod\nto the name of Christ, and will shine as brightly in your crown as if\nyou had found that soul in China or India.8"

Religion\nbrought into the home exerts an influence that cannot be measured.17\nGood Behavior at Home Influences Others, [256]\nBe of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly. 1\nChronicles 19:13.\nThe Saviour of the world loves to have children and youth give\ntheir hearts to Him.... Through childhood and youth, they will be\nfound faithful disciples of our Lord.... In your earliest years you\nmay be a blessing in the home.18\nEven through children and youth the light of life may shine upon\nthose who sit in darkness.

Do the things that you know to be right. Be obedient to\nyour parents. Listen to their counsels; for if they love and fear God,\nupon them will be laid the responsibility of educating, disciplining,\nand training your soul for the immortal life. Thankfully receive the\nhelp they want to give you, and make their hearts glad by cheerfully\nsubmitting yourselves to the dictates of their wiser judgments. In\nthis way you will honor your parents, glorify God, and become a\nblessing to those with whom you associate.19\nWe want children and youth to be happy in this life, and to bring\nall that makes heaven desirable—a place of peace and bliss—into\nthe home life. Train yourselves to behave at home, having the fear of\nthe Lord before you, and it will become habit to behave well when\naway from home.... Let love be cherished, and peace, and Christian\npoliteness, and angels will be your guests.20\n[257] Job Offered Sacrifices for His Children, September\nAnd it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about,\nthat Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the\nmorning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number\nof them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned,\nand cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually. Job\n1:5.\nThere are two ways to deal with children,—ways that differ\nwidely in principle and in results. Faithfulness and love, united with\nwisdom and firmness, in accordance with the teachings of God’s\nWord, will bring happiness in this life and in the next. Neglect of\nduty, injudicious indulgence, failure to restrain or correct the follies\nof youth, will result in unhappiness and final ruin to the children,\nand disappointment and anguish to the parents....\nIt were well for parents to learn from the man of Uz a lesson\nof steadfastness and devotion. Job did not neglect his duty to those\noutside of his household; he was benevolent, kind, thoughtful of\nthe interests of others; and at the same time he labored earnestly\nfor the salvation of his own family. Amid the festivities of his sons\nand daughters, he trembled lest his children should displease God.\nAs a faithful priest of the household, he offered sacrifices for them\nindividually. He knew the offensive character of sin, and the thought\nthat his children might forget the divine claims, led him to God as\nan intercessor in their behalf.21\nHe [God] desires to see gathered out from the homes of our peo-\nple a large company of youth who, because of the godly influences\nof their homes, have surrendered their hearts to Him and go forth\nto give Him the highest service of their lives. Directed and trained\nby the godly instruction of the home, the influence of the morning\nand evening worship, the consistent example of parents who love\nand fear God, they have learned to submit to God as their teacher\nJobOfferedSacrificesforHisChildren,September7 345\nand are prepared to render Him acceptable service as loyal sons and\ndaughters. Such youth are prepared to represent to the world the\npower and grace of Christ.22\n[258] Far-reaching Influence of Christian Home,\nO God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have\nI declared thy wondrous works. Psalm 71:17.\nThe temper, the personal peculiarities, the habits from which\ncharacter is developed—everything practiced in the home will reveal\nitself in all the associations of life. The inclinations followed will\nwork out in thoughts, in words, in acts of the same character.23\nThe mission of the home extends beyond its own members. The\nChristian home is to be an object-lesson, illustrating the excellence\nof the true principles of life. Such an illustration will be a power\nfor good in the world. Far more powerful than any sermon that\ncan be preached is the influence of a true home.... As the youth go\nout from such a home, the lessons they have learned are imparted.\nNobler principles of life are introduced into other households, and\nan uplifting influence works in the community.24\nThe home in which the members are polite, courteous Christians\nexerts a far-reaching influence for good. Other families will mark\nthe results attained by such a home, and will follow the example\nset, in their turn guarding the home against satanic influences. The\nangels of God will often visit the home in which the will of God\nbears sway. Under the power of divine grace such a home becomes a\nplace of refreshing to worn, weary pilgrims. By watchful guarding,\nself is kept from asserting itself. Correct habits are formed. There\nis a careful recognition of the rights of others. The faith that works\nby love and purifies the soul stands at the helm, presiding over the\nwhole household. Under the hallowed influence of such a home,\nthe principle of brotherhood laid down in the Word of God is more\nwidely recognized and obeyed.25\nThe life of Christ is before us as a pattern, and it is when min-\nistering, like angels of mercy, to the wants of others that man is\nFar-reachingInfluenceofChristianHome,September8 347\nclosely allied to God.

He will treat His\nbackslidden ones with tenderness. He will speak pardon to them,\nand clothe them with the garments of Christ’s righteousness. He will\nhonor them with His presence.\nIn this, the great day of atonement, it is our duty to confess\nour sins and acknowledge God’s mercy and love in pardoning our\ntransgressions. Let us thank the Lord for the warnings He has given\nto save us from our perverse ways. Let us witness to His goodness\nby revealing a change in our lives. If those to whom the Lord has\nsent reproof, warning them that they are not walking in His way, will\nrepent, and with humility and contrition of heart make confession,\nthe Lord will surely receive them again into favor....\nA season of great trial is before us. It becomes us now to use all\nour capabilities and gifts in advancing the work of God. The powers\ntheLordhasgivenusaretobeusedtobuildup, nottodiscourageand\nto teardown.... In all ages of the church God’s appointed messengers\nhave exposed themselves to reproach and persecution for the truth’s\nsake. But wherever God’s people may be forced to go, even though,\nlike the beloved disciple, they are banished to desert islands, Christ\nwill know where they are, and will strengthen and bless them, filling\nthem with peace and joy....\nHe will purify His church even as He purified the temple at the\nbeginning and close of His ministry on earth. All that He brings\nupon the church in test and trial comes that His people may gain\ndeeper piety and more strength to carry the triumphs of the cross to\nall parts of the world. He has a work for all to do.28"

        "content": "I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in\npersecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake. 2 Corinthians\n12:10.\nIn every age God’s chosen messengers have been reviled and\npersecuted; yet through their affliction, the knowledge of God has\nbeen spread abroad. Every disciple of Christ is to step into the\nranks, and carry forward the same work, knowing that its foes can\ndo nothing against the truth, but for the truth. God means that truth\nshall be brought to the front, and become the subject of examination\nanddiscussion, eventhroughthecontemptplaceduponit. Theminds\nof the people must be agitated; every controversy, every reproach,\nevery effort to restrict liberty of conscience, is God’s means of\nawakening minds that otherwise might slumber.\nHow often this result has been seen in the history of God’s\nmessengers! When the noble and eloquent Stephen was stoned to\ndeath at the instigation of the Sanhedrin council, there was no loss\nto the cause of the gospel. The light of heaven that glorified his face,\nthe divine compassion breathed in his dying prayer, were as a sharp\narrowofconvictiontothebigotedSanhedristwhostoodby, andSaul,\nthe persecuting Pharisee, became a chosen vessel, to bear the name\nof Christ before Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel. And\nlong afterward Paul the aged wrote from his prison-house at Rome:\n“Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife, ... not sincerely,\nsupposing to add affliction to my bonds.... Notwithstanding, every\nway, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached.” Through\nPaul’s imprisonment the gospel was spread abroad, and souls were\nwon for Christ in the very palace of the Caesars. By the efforts of\nSatan to destroy it, “the incorruptible seed” of the Word of God,\n“which liveth and abideth forever,” is sown in the hearts of men;\nthrough the reproach and persecution of His children, the name of\nChrist is magnified, and souls are saved.29"

        "content": "As a people, we are not deficient in talent. There are men and\nwomen among us whose labors God would accept if they would\noffer them to Him, but there are so very few who have the spirit of\nsacrifice. Some will hand out readily of their means, and feel that\nwhen they have done this, there is no more required of them. They\nmake no special sacrifice in thus doing. Money is good as far as it\ngoes, but, unless accompanied by personal effort, will go but a little\nway toward converting souls to the truth. Not only does God call for\nyour money, ... but He calls for you. While you have given of your\nmeans, you have selfishly withheld yourselves. One earnest worker\nin the vineyard is worth more than a million of money without men\nto do the work. This giving of yourselves will be a sacrifice if you\nhave a correct estimate of the work, and realize its claims....\nMany are not sufficiently aroused to their duty to do the work\nthey might do if they would, and that they do not do because they\nhave not the spirit of sacrifice. God will hold such accountable for\nthe souls of their fellow-men. They might have done a good work in\nunion with Christ, and they will be called to render an account for\nthe good to souls they could have done and did not....\nThe night soon cometh, in which no man can work. Satan is\nearnest, zealous, and persevering in his work. If he fails to accom-\nplish his purpose the first time, he tries again. He will try otherplans,\nand work with great perseverance to bring in various temptations\nto ensnare souls. He never becomes so discouraged as to let souls\nentirely alone. If the zeal and perseverance of Christ’s followers in\ntheir efforts to save souls were equal to Satan’s efforts to deceive\nthem to their eternal loss, we should see hundreds embracing the\ntruth where we now see one.32\n[264] God Places Benevolence Close Beside Prayer,\nThy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before\nGod. Acts 10:4.\nTrue Christian benevolence springs from the principle ofgrateful\nlove. Love to Christ cannot exist without corresponding love to\nthose whom He came into the world to redeem. Love to Christ\nmust be the ruling principle of the being, controlling all its emotions\nand directing all its energies. Redeeming love should awaken all\nthat tender affection and self-sacrificing devotion that is possible to\nexist in the heart of man. When this is the case, no heart-stirring\nappeals will be needed to break through their selfishness and awaken\ntheir dormant sympathies, to call forth benevolent offerings for the\nprecious cause of truth....\nRightly directed benevolence draws upon the mental and moral\nenergiesofmen,andexcitesthemtomosthealthfulactioninblessing\nthe needy and in advancing the cause of God. If those who have\nmeans should realize that they are accountable to God for every\ndollar that they expend, their supposed wants would be much less.\nIf conscience was alive, she would testify of needless appropriations\nin the gratification of the appetite, and in ministering to pride, to\nvanity, andtoamusements, andreportthesquanderingoftheirLord’s\nmoney, which should have been devoted to His cause....\nThe length and happiness of life consist not in the amount of our\nearthly possessions....\nThose churches who are the most systematic and liberal in sus-\ntaining the cause of God, are the most prosperous spiritually. True\nliberality in the follower of Christ identifies his interest with that of\nhis Master.... Worldliness and covetousness are eating out the vitals\nof God’s people.

But to invest the\nsimplest truths with novelty and singularity, is to rob them of their\npower to win souls to Christ.... The use of long words and soaring\neloquence is not essential to success. What you need is a living\nexperience in the things of God, and simplicity in presenting the\nlove of Christ to the lost.... When the heart is aglow with the love\nof Jesus, you will express it to others, and become witnesses for\nChrist.37\nWe are not to hide the gospel, or cover the cross of Christ with\nornamental roses and thus make the preaching of it of no effect.38\nThe true, honest expression of a son or daughter of God, spoken\nin natural simplicity, has power to unbolt the door to hearts that have\nlong been closed against Christ and His love.39"

        "content": "“Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord.” Thank God that it is our\nprivilege to be called witnesses for God. Then if we are witnesses,\nwe must speak for Christ, and lift Him up among our associates.\nWhen we see the ardor and religious zeal of any of our companions\ngrowing cool, we must help and encourage such a one, pray with\nand for him, that he may be a true witness for the Lord....\nYou are to be the agent through whom God will speak to the\nsoul. Precious things will be brought to your remembrance, and with\na heart overflowing with the love of Jesus, you will speak words of\nvital interest and import. Your simplicity and sincerity will be the\nhighest eloquence, and your words will be registered in the books\nof heaven as fit words, which are like apples of gold in pictures of\nsilver. God will make them a healing flood of heavenly influence,\nawakening conviction and desire, and Jesus will add His intercession\nto your prayers, and claim for the sinner the gift of the Holy Spirit,\nand pour it upon his soul. And there will be joy in the presence of\nthe angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.56\nThe work above all work,—the business above all others which\nshould draw and engage the energies of the soul,—is the work of\nsaving souls for whom Christ has died. Make this the main, the im-\nportant work of your life. Make it your special life-work. Cooperate\nwith Christ in this grand and noble work, and become home and\nforeign missionaries. Be ready and efficient to work at home or in\nfar-off climes for the saving of souls.... O that young and old were\nthoroughly converted to God, and would take up the duty that lies\nnext them, and work as they have opportunity, becoming laborers\ntogether with God! Should this come to pass, multitudes of voices\nwould show forth the praises of Him who hath called them out of\ndarkness into His marvelous light.57\n[275] We Give Liberally To Spread the Gospel, September\nHonour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of\nall thine increase. Proverbs 3:9.\nAre you not chosen of God to be a vessel unto honor, to convey\nlight and truth to those who are in error and darkness? The saving\nmessage of truth has come to you, and if you receive of the spirit of\nChrist, you will have a love for the souls who are in peril.58\nMen will compass land and sea for earthly gain, and endure\nprivation and suffering to obtain their object, yet will turn away from\nheaven’s attractions, and not regard eternal riches. Men who are in\ncomparative poverty are usually the ones who do the most to sustain\nthe cause of God. They are generous with their little. They have\nstrengthenedtheirgenerous impulses by continualliberalities. When\ntheir expenditures pressed close upon the income, their passion for\nearthly riches had no room or chance to strengthen. But many, when\nthey begin to gather earthly riches, commence to calculate how long\nit will be before they can be in possession of a certain sum. In their\nanxiety to amass wealth for themselves, they fail to become rich\ntoward God.59\nIt should be your object, in whatever vocation you may be found,\nto do yourwork in a mannerthat shall glorify God. All that you gain,\nyou should look upon as capital to be invested in the bank of heaven.\nIt should be your joy to devote means, and time, and ability to win\nsouls for Christ, to send the light to those who sit in darkness.60\nThe Lord has ordained that the diffusion of light and truth in the\nearth shall be dependent upon the efforts and offerings of those who\nare partakers of the heavenly gift. He might have made angels the\nambassadors of His truth; He might have made known His will, as\nHe proclaimed the law from Sinai, with His own voice; but in His\ninfinite love and wisdom He called men to become co-laborers with\nHimself, by choosing them to do this work.61"

        "content": "Our duty will only be discerned and appreciated when viewed\nin the light which shines from the life of Christ. As the sun rises in\nthe east and passes toward the west, filling the world with light, so\nthe true follower of Christ will be a light unto the world. He will\ngo forth into the world as a bright and shining light, that those who\nare in darkness may be lightened and warmed by the rays shining\nforth from him. Christ says of His followers, “Ye are the light of the\nworld.”62\nThose who do not work in hopefulness, keep themselves under\na cloud of doubt. The enemy is not dead yet, and the nearer we\ncome to the close of this earth’s history, the more vigilant will be\nthe efforts of satanic agencies to keep souls under a cloud of doubt,\nso that the light of heaven shall not be expressed in words and acts,\nto bring hope and cheer and courage to others....\nThe world is full of hurry and disappointment. The words are\naddressed to you, “Let your light so shine before men, that they may\nsee your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.”\nThe words in favor of truth, spoken with the assurance that comes\nfrom the possession of a right purpose, and in cheerful hope, from a\npure heart, will make the angels rejoice. The Lord would have us\nspiritually minded, that we may be able to see the working out of\nHis plans in our lives. We are to be laborers together with God in\naccomplishing the work that He would have done. Wherever we are,\nwe are to reflect light.63\nWhen the grace of Christ is expressed in the words and works\nof the believers, light will shine forth to those who are in darkness;\nfor while the lips are speaking to the praise of God, the hand will be\nstretched out in beneficence for the help of the perishing.64\n[277] We are to Work with Christ to Save the Lost,\nAnd when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and\nneighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have\nfound my sheep which was lost. Luke 15:6.\nWhen Jesus spoke these words, He was talking to a company,\nmany of whom knew by experience what a shepherd’s life is in\nPalestine. There the flocks are not kept in level, inclosed pastures,\nbut on the hill-sides, among crags and precipices....\nThere was always the danger from robbers and wolves to be\nguarded against. Sometimes a sheep would stray away from the\nflock; so they were frequently numbered to see that none were lost,\nfor the shepherd must give a strict account of all the sheep under his\ncare.... The shepherd’s life is one full of peril. If he is a trustworthy\nshepherd, he will not be careless and study his own ease, but he will\nsearch for the straying sheep amid storm and tempest....\nThis is the way the true Shepherd treats the lost sinner. He goes\nafter him; He does not hesitate at peril, self-denial, and self-sacrifice.\nHe is intent upon bringing the sin-burdened soul to repentance, to\nsalvation, to peace, rest, and happiness in his Saviour’s love. And it\nis the privilege of every one who has experienced the love of Jesus\nin his own heart, to think if there is not some one whom he can by\npersonal effort, by studied tact and kindness, bring to Jesus, who\nis ready and willing to accept all who will come to Him. We can\nall do much through personal effort. We can be laborers with Jesus\nChrist.65\nLife is serious. You have a large field in which to work; and\npersevering search for the lost sheep will be the most successful way\nin which you can employ your time.... If you can exert a saving\ninfluence over one soul, remember there is joy in heaven over the\none that repented.... You may, by judicious effort, be the means of\nbringing back the lost sheep to Jesus’ fold.66"

        "verse_ref": " John 1:4",
        "content": "The Lord has made every provision so that we may have a rich,\nabundant, joyful experience. John writes concerning Christ, saying,\n“In him was life; and the life was the light of men.” Life is associated\nwith light, and if we have no light from the Sun of Righteousness,\nwe can have no life in Him. But this light has been provided for\nevery soul, and it is only as we withdraw from the light that darkness\ncomes upon us. Jesus said, “He that followeth me shall not walk in\ndarkness, but shall have the light of life.” In the world about us there\ncan be no life without light. Were the sun to withdraw his shining,\nall vegetation, all animal life, would have an end. This illustrates\nthe fact that we cannot have spiritual life unless we place ourselves\nunder the beams of the Sun of Righteousness. If we put a flowering\nplant in a dark room, it will soon wither and die; and so we may\nhave some spiritual life, and yet lose it by dwelling in an atmosphere\nof doubt and gloom....\nWe are called, as was John, not to take the place of Christ, but\nto witness to the light, to direct the minds of others to Him.... Let\nno one who would witness for Christ, make himself prominent, and\nseek to attract the attention of the people to himself; but let him\nstrive to lift up Jesus.1\nHumanity has in itself no light. Apart from Christ, we are like\nan unkindled taper, like the moon when her face is turned away\nfrom the sun; we have not a single ray of brightness to shed into\nthe darkness of the world. But when we turn toward the Sun of\nRighteousness, when we come in touch with Christ, the whole soul\nis aglow with the brightness of the divine presence.2\nBy Abiding in Christ, the Source of Power, October [282]\nFor in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And\nye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality\nand power. Colossians 2:9, 10.\nTheLordJesusactsthroughtheHolySpirit; foritisHisrepresen-\ntative.

Jesus has large blessings to bestow,\nrich gifts to distribute among men. He is the wonderful Counselor,\ninfinite in wisdom and strength; and if we will acknowledge the\npower of His Spirit, and submit to be molded by it, we shall stand\ncomplete in Him. What a thought is this! In Christ “dwelleth all the\nfulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in him.”\nNever will the human heart know happiness until it is submitted\nto be molded by the Spirit of God. The Spirit conforms the renewed\nsoul to the model, Jesus Christ. Through the influence of the Spirit,\nenmity against God is changed into faith and love, and pride into\nhumility. The soul perceives the beauty of truth, and Christ is hon-\nored in excellence and perfection of character. As these changes are\neffected, angels break out in rapturous song, and God and Christ\nrejoice over souls fashioned after the divine similitude.3\nJehovah Emmanuel—He “in whom are hid all the treasures\nof wisdom and knowledge,” in whom dwells “all the fulness of\nthe Godhead bodily”—to be brought into sympathy with Him, to\nknow Him, to possess Him, as the heart opens more and more to\nreceive His attributes; to know His love and power, to possess the\nunsearchable riches of Christ, to comprehend more and more “what\nis the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the\nlove of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with\nall the fulness of God,”—“this is the heritage of the servants of the\nLord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.”4"

The truth works by love, and purifieth the\nsoul.18\nOur professions are worthless unless we abide in Christ; for\nwe cannot be living branches unless the vital qualities of the Vine\nabound in us. In the genuine Christian the characteristics of his\nMaster will appear, and when we reflect the graces of Christ in our\nlives and characters, the Father loves us as He loves His Son. When\nthis condition is fulfilled in those who profess to believe the present\ntruth, we shall see a prosperous church; for its members will not live\nunto themselves, but unto Him who died for them, and they will be\nflourishing branches of the living Vine.19\nThe root of the tree has a double office to fill. It is to hold fast\nby its tendrils to the earth, while it takes to itself the nourishment\ndesired. Thus it is with the Christian. When his union with Christ,\nthe parent stock, is complete, when he feeds upon Him, currents\nof spiritual strength are given to him. Can the leaves of such a\nbranch wither?—Never! As long as the soul reaches toward Christ,\nthere is little danger that he will wilt, and droop, and decay. The\ntemptations that may come in like a tempest will not uproot him.\n384 SonsandDaughtersofGod\nThe true Christian draws his motives of action from his deep love\nfor his Redeemer. His affection for his Master is true and holy.20\nGod Prunes Us to Make Us More Fruitful, October [289]\nEvery branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and\nevery branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may\nbring forth more fruit. John 15:2.\nThose who will walk closely in the footsteps of their self-sacri-\nficing, self-denying Redeemer will have the mind of Christ reflected\nin their minds. Purity and the love of Christ will shine forth in\ntheir daily lives and characters, while meekness and truth will guide\ntheir way. Every fruitful branch is pruned, that it may bring forth\nmore fruit. Even fruitful branches may display too much foliage\nand appear what they really are not. The followers of Christ may\nbe doing some work for the Master and yet not be doing half what\nthey might do. He then prunes them, because worldliness, self-in-\ndulgence, and pride are cropping out in their lives. Husbandmen\nclip off the surplus tendrils of the vines ..., thus making them more\nfruitful. These hindering causes must be removed and the defective\noutgrowth cut away, to give room for the healing beams of the Sun\nof Righteousness....\nMany misunderstand the object for which they were created. It\nwas to bless humanity and glorify God, rather than to enjoy and\nglorify self. God is constantly pruning His people, cutting off pro-\nfuse, spreading branches, that they may bear fruit to His glory and\nnot produce leaves only. God prunes us with sorrow, with disap-\npointment and affliction, that the outgrowth of strong, perverse traits\nof character may be weakened and that the better traits may have\na chance to develop. Idols must be given up, the conscience must\nbecome more tender, the meditations of the heart must be spiritual,\nand the entire character must become symmetrical.21\nBy abiding in Christ, we may have His sweetness, His fragrance,\nHis light.... He shines in our hearts. His light in our hearts shines\n386 SonsandDaughtersofGod\nforth from our faces. By beholding the beauty and the glory of\nChrist, we become changed into the same image.22\nWe Bear Fruit Only as We Abide in Christ, October [290]\nAbide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of\nitself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye\nabide in me. John 15:4.\nThe reason that we carelessly indulge in sin is that we do not see\nJesus. We would not lightly regard sin, did we appreciate the fact\nthat sin wounds our Lord.... A right estimate of the character of God\nwould enable us rightly to represent Him to the world. Harshness,\nroughness in words or manner, evil-speaking, passionate words,\ncannot exist in the soul that is looking unto Jesus. He who abides in\nChristisinanatmospherethatforbidsevil, andgivesnottheslightest\nexcuse for anything of this kind. Spiritual life is not nourished from\nwithin, but draws its nutrition from Christ, as the branch does from\nthe vine. We are dependent upon Christ every moment; He is our\nsource of supply. All our outside forms, prayers, fastings, and alms-\ngiving cannot take the place of the inward work of the Spirit of God\non the human heart.23\nWhen one is fully emptied of self, when every false god is\ncast out of the soul, the vacuum is filled by the inflowing of the\nSpirit of Christ. Such a one has the faith that purifies the soul\nfrom defilement.... He is a branch of the True Vine, and bears rich\nclusters of fruit to the glory of God. What is the character of the\nfruit borne?—The fruit of the Spirit is “love,” not hatred; “joy,”\nnot discontent and mourning; “peace,” not irritation, anxiety, and\nmanufactured trials. It is “long-suffering, gentleness, goodness,\nfaith, meekness, temperance.”24GospelWorkers,287,288.\nOne branch is not to borrow its sustenance from another. Our\nlife must come from the parent vine. It is only by personal union\nwith Christ, by communion with Him daily, hourly, that we can bear\nthe fruits of the Holy Spirit.... Our growth in grace, our joy, our\n388 SonsandDaughtersofGod\nusefulness, all depend on our union with Christ and the degree of\nfaith we exercise in Him.25"

The twig holds fast to the\nlife-giving vine, until the life of the vine becomes the life of the\nbranch, and it produces fruit like that of the vine.26\n“I am the vine,” said Christ; “ye are the branches.” The closest\npossible connection is here represented. Engraft the leafless twig\nupon the flourishing vine stock, and it becomes a living branch,\ndrawing sap and nourishment from the vine. Fiber by fiber, vein by\nvein, the sapling clings, until it buds and blossoms and bears fruit.\nThe sapless twig represents the sinner. When united to Christ, soul\nis joined to soul, the feeble and finite to the holy and infinite, and\nman becomes one with Christ.27\nThe apparently dry branch, by being connected with the living\nvine, becomes a part of it.... The soul, dead in trespasses and sins,\nmust experience a similar process.... As the graft receives life when\nunited to the vine, so the sinner partakes of the divine nature when\nconnected with Christ.

Those who are accounted by God as His\nchildren will reveal Christlike love for one another. They will live\nand work for one object,—the proper representation of Christ to the\nworld. By their love and unity they will show to the world that they\nbear the divine credentials. By the nobility of love and self-denial,\nthey will show those around them that they are true followers of the\nSaviour. “By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye\nhave love one to another.” ...\nThe most powerful evidence a man can give that he has been\nborn again and is a new man in Christ Jesus, is the manifestation\nof love for his brethren, the doing of Christlike deeds. This is the\nmost wonderful witness that can be borne in favor of Christianity,\nand will win souls to the truth....\nChrist brings all true believers into complete oneness with Him-\nself, even the oneness which exists between Him and His Father.\nThe true children of God are bound up with one another and with\ntheir Saviour.

John 17:21.\nChrist has left us a perfect, sinless example. His followers are to\nwalk in His footsteps. If they are not transformed in character, they\ncan never dwell with Him in His kingdom. Christ died to elevate\nand ennoble them, and those who retain hereditary tendencies to\nwrong can not dwell with Him. He suffered all that it is possible for\nhuman flesh to suffer and endure, that we might pass triumphantly\nthrough all the temptations Satan may invent to destroy our faith.\nIn Christ is our only hope.

Henceforth Christ would live through their faculties, and\nspeak through their words. They were privileged to know that here-\nafter He and they were to be one. They must cherish His principles\nand be controlled by His Spirit. They were no longer to follow their\nown way, to speak their own words. The words they spoke were to\nproceed from a sanctified heart, and fall from sanctified lips. No\nlonger were they to live their own selfish life; Christ was to live in\nthem....

        "content": "The mourning here brought to view is true heart sorrow for sin....\nAs one is drawn to behold Jesus uplifted on the cross, he discerns\nthe sinfulness of humanity. He sees that it is sin which scourged and\ncrucified the Lord of glory. He sees that, while he has been loved\nwith unspeakable tenderness, his life has been a continual scene\nof ingratitude and rebellion. He has forsaken his best Friend, and\nabused heaven’s most precious gift. He has crucified to himself the\nSon ofGodafresh, andpiercedanewthatbleeding andstricken heart.\nHe is separated from God by a gulf of sin that is broad and black\nand deep, and he mourns in brokenness of heart. Such mourning\n“shall be comforted.” God reveals to us our guilt that we may flee\nto Christ, and through Him be set free from the bondage of sin, and\nrejoice in the liberty of the sons of God. In true contrition we may\ncome to the foot of the cross, and there leave our burdens....\nThe Saviour’s words have a message of comfort to those also\nwho are suffering affliction or bereavement. Our sorrows do not\nspring out of the ground. God “doth not afflict willingly nor grieve\nthe children ofmen.” When He permits trials andafflictions, itis “for\nour profit, that we might be partakers of His holiness.” If received\nin faith, the trial that seems so bitter and hard to bear will prove a\nblessing. The cruel blow that blights the joys of earth will be the\nmeans of turning our eyes to heaven. How many there are who\nwould never have known Jesus had not sorrow led them to seek\ncomfort in Him! ...\nThe Lord will work for all who put their trust in Him. Precious\nvictories will be gained by the faithful. Precious lessons will be\nlearned. Precious experiences will be realized....\nChrist lifts up the contrite heart, and refines the mourning soul,\nuntil it becomes His abode.47"

Theywere\ndeeply moved; their minds were impressed that He was repeating\nthe command from the most excellent glory.

Matthew\n5:7.\nThe heart of man is by nature cold and dark and unloving; when-\never one manifests a spirit of mercy and forgiveness, he does it not\nof himself, but through the influence of the Divine Spirit moving\nupon his heart. “We love, because he first loved us.”\nGod is Himself the source of all mercy. His name is “merciful\nand gracious.” He does not treat us according to our desert. He does\nnot ask if we are worthy of His love, but He pours upon us the riches\nof His love, to make us worthy. He is not vindictive. He seeks not to\npunish, buttoredeem. Even theseveritywhichHemanifeststhrough\nHis providences is manifested for the salvation of the wayward. He\nyearns with intense desire to relieve the woes of men.... All whose\nhearts are in sympathy with the heart of Infinite Love will seek to\nreclaim, and not to condemn. Christ dwelling in the soul is a spring\nthat never runs dry. Where He abides, there will be an overflowing\nof beneficence.\nTo the appeal of the erring, the tempted, the wretched victims\nof want and sin, the Christian does not ask, Are they worthy? but,\nHow can I benefit them? In the most wretched, the most debased, he\nsees souls whom Christ died to save.... The merciful are those who\nmanifest compassion to the poor, the suffering, and the oppressed....\nHe who has given his life to God in ministry to His children,\nis linked with Him who has all the resources of the universe at His\ncommand. His life is bound up by the golden chain of the immutable\npromises with the life of God. The Lord will not fail him in the hour\nof suffering and need. “My God shall supply all your need according\nto his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.” And in the hour of final need\nthe merciful shall find refuge in the mercy of the compassionate\nSaviour, and shall be received into everlasting habitations.51\n[306] The Peacemakers are Called God’s Children,\nBlessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the\nchildren of God. Matthew 5:9.\nChrist is “the Prince of peace,” and it is His mission to restore\nto earth and heaven the peace that sin has broken. “Being justified\nby faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”\nWhoever consents to renounce sin, and open his heart to the love of\nChrist, becomes a partaker of this heavenly peace.\nThere is no other ground of peace than this. The grace of Christ\nreceived into the heart, subdues enmity; it allays strife, and fills the\nsoul with love. He who is at peace with God and his fellow-men can\nnot be made miserable. Envy will not be in his heart; evil surmisings\nwill find no room there; hatred can not exist. The heart that is in\nharmony with God is a partaker of the peace of heaven, and will\ndiffuse its blessed influence on all around. The spirit of peace will\nrest like dew upon hearts weary and troubled with worldly strife.\nChrist’s followers are sent to the world with the message of\npeace. Whoever, by the quiet, unconscious influence of a holy life,\nshall reveal the love of Christ; whoever, by word or deed, shall lead\nanother to renounce sin and yield his heart to God, is a peacemaker.\nAnd “blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the\nchildren of God.” The spirit of peace is evidence of their connec-\ntion with heaven. The sweet savor of Christ surrounds them. The\nfragrance of the life, the loveliness of the character, reveal to the\nworld the fact that they are children of God. Men take knowledge\nof them that they have been with Jesus. “Every one that loveth is\nborn of God.” “If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none\nof his;” but “as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the\nsons of God.” “And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of\nmany people as a dew from the Lord, as the showers upon the grass,\nthat tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.”52"

Every nerve and muscle, every mental\nand physical endowment, is to be kept pure.\nGod designs that the body shall be as a temple for His Spirit.\nSolemn is the accountability resting upon every soul.

Christians are under obligation to God to keep soul, body, and\nspirit free from all that will defile; for they have been bought with a\nprice....\nNo man or woman has any right to form habits which lessen the\nhealthful action of one organ of mind or body.... Those who give\nthemselves up to the use of tobacco and liquor do not appreciate\ntheir intellect. They do not realize the value of the faculties God has\ngiven them, to be cultivated and improved. Thus men allow their\npowers to wither and decay. God desires all who believe in Him\nto feel the necessity of improvement. Every entrusted faculty is to\nbe enlarged. Not one gift is to be laid aside. As God’s husbandry\nand building, man is under His supervision in every sense of the\nword, and the better he becomes acquainted with his Maker, the\nmore sacred will his life become in his estimation.6\n[314] God’s Temple Is to Receive Constant Care,\nYe are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will\ndwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and\nthey shall be my people. 2 Corinthians 6:16.\nWe are to obey the laws of His kingdom, making ourselves all\nthatitispossibleforustobe.

This we may\ndo; for Enoch pleased God, though living in a degenerate age. And\nthere are Enochs in this our day.\nThe human house, God’s building, His temple, requires close,\nvigilant, watchful guardianship. With David we can exclaim, “I\nam fearfully and wonderfully made.” God’s workmanship is to be\npreserved, that it may be revealed to the heavenly universe and to\nthe apostate race that men and women are temples of the living God.\nThe perfection of character which God requires is the fitting up\nof the whole being as a temple for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.\nThe Lord requires the service of the entire human machinery. He\ndesires men and women to be all that He has made it possible for\nthem to be. It is not enough for certain parts of the machinery to\nbe used. All parts must be brought into action, or the service is\ndeficient....\nThe physical life is to be carefully educated, cultivated, and\ndeveloped, that through men and women the divine nature may be\nrevealed in its fullness. God expects men to use the intellect He has\ngiven them. He expects them to use every reasoning power for Him.\nThey are to give the conscience the place of supremacy that has been\nassigned it. The mental and physical powers, with the affections, are\nto be so cultivated that they can reach the highest efficiency.7\nGod Wants Us to Have the Best Manners, November [315]\nBe not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. 1\nCorinthians 15:33.\nThe religion of Christ never degrades the receiver, never makes\nhim coarse or rough or uncourteous.8\nThere is much to do in order to fit us for the courts of the Lord.\nThe roughness of spirit, the coarseness of speech, the cheapness\nof character, must be put away, or we can never wear the garment\nwoven in the heavenly loom,—the righteousness of Christ....\nThose who, under the education of Christ, make it possible to\nreach the highest attainments will take every divine improvement\nwith them to the higher school. But those who are unwilling to have\ntheir characters molded after the divine similitude make the angels\nsad; for by clinging to their sinful habits and practices they spoil the\ndesign of God.9\nBe polite to God and to one another. Remember that He wants\nyou to have the best of manners, that you may glorify Him before\nthe world. He desires you to live in unity with one another and to\nlove one another. Remember that if you love one another here, you\nwill live with the redeemed through the ceaseless ages of eternity.10\nSelfishness and pride hinder the pure love that unites us in spirit\nwith Jesus Christ. If this love is truly cultivated, finite will blend\nwith finite, and all will center in the Infinite. Humanity will unite\nwith humanity, and all will be bound up with the heart of Infinite\nlove. Sanctified love for one another is sacred. In this great work\nChristian love for one another,—far higher, more constant, more\ncourteous, more unselfish, than has been seen,—preserves Christian\ntenderness, Christian benevolence, and politeness, and enfolds the\nhuman brotherhood in the embrace of God, acknowledging the\ndignity with which God has invested the rights of man.

But few realize\nthat they drive away the Spirit of God with their selfish thoughts\nand feelings, their foolish, trifling talk.... If the grace of Christ were\nplanted in their hearts, and striking its roots down deep into good\nsoil, they would bear fruit of an altogether different character....\nThe converting power of God is alone sufficient to establish pure\nprinciples in the heart, so that the wicked one may find nothing to\nassail....

Through the grace of Christ, man’s mind is qualified\nto love and glorify God, the Creator.\nThe Lord Jesus came to our world to represent the Father....\nChrist was the express image of His Father’s person; and He came\nto our world to restore in man God’s moral image, in order that man\nalthough fallen, might through obedience to God’s commandments\nbecome enstamped with the divine image and character.15\nGod wants children to be lovely, not with artificial adornment,\nbut with beauty of character, the charms of kindness and affection,\nwhich will make their hearts bound with joy and happiness.16\nGirls should be taught that the true charm of womanliness is not\nalone in beauty of form or feature, nor in the possession of accom-\nplishments; but in a meek and quiet spirit, in patience, generosity,\nkindness, and a willingness to do and suffer for others. They should\nbe taught to work, to study to some purpose, to live for some object,\nto trust in God and fear Him, and to respect their parents. Then as\nthey advance in years, they willgrow more pure-minded, self-reliant,\nand beloved. It will be impossible to degrade such a woman.

If you appreciated the value\nof the work that is to be done in the workshop of God, you would\nwelcome the blows of the ax and the hammer.

This was manifested\nin so marked a manner that Potiphar, in whose house he served,\nattributed all his blessings to his purchased slave.21\nJoseph’s religion kept his temper sweet and his sympathy with\nhumanity warm and strong, notwithstanding all his trials.

No sooner does he enter upon prison life, than\nhe brings all the brightness of his Christian principles into active\nexercise; he begins to make himself useful to others. He enters\ninto the troubles of his fellow prisoners. He is cheerful, for he is a\nChristian gentleman. God was preparing him under this discipline\nfor a situation of great responsibility, honor, and usefulness, and he\nwas willing to learn; he took kindly to the lessons the Lord would\nteach him. He learned to bear the yoke in his youth. He learned to\ngovern by first learning obedience himself....\nThe part which Joseph acted in connection with the scenes of\nthe gloomy prison, was that which raised him finally to prosperity\nand honor.

Genesis 13:9.\nAbraham’s household comprised more than a thousand souls.\nThose who were led by his teachings to worship the true God found\na home in his encampment; and here, as in a school, they received\nsuch instruction as would prepare them to be representatives of the\nfaith. Abraham’s affection for his children and his household led\nhim to guard their religious faith, to impart to them a knowledge of\nthe divine statutes, as the most precious legacy he could transmit to\nthem, and through them to the world. All were taught that they were\nunder the rule of the God of heaven. There was to be no oppression\non the part of parents, and no disobedience on the part of children.\nGod’s law had appointed to each his duties, and only in obedience\ncould any secure happiness and prosperity.\nHis own example, the silent influence of his daily life, was a\nconstant lesson. The unswerving integrity, the benevolence and\nunselfish courtesy which had won the admiration of kings, were\ndisplayed in the home. There was a fragrance about the life, a\nnobility and loveliness of character, which revealed to all that he was\nconnected with heaven. He did not neglect the soul of the humblest\nservant. In his household there was not one law for the master, and\none for the servant; a royal way for the rich, and another for the poor.\nAll were treated with justice and compassion.23\nHe was a man of faith, who always followed principles of the\nstrictest integrity. In all his business transactions he was courteous\nand honorable. His life was controlled by Christian politeness, and\nhe placed the service of the Lord before all else. He would not\nswerve a hair’s breadth from pure, Christian principles.24\nAbrahamEverDisplayedUnselfishCourtesy,November10 427\nIt is in the power of every one to practise true Christlike cour-\ntesy.25\n[322] Capabilities Increase as Spirituality Increases,\nAs for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill\nin all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in\nall visions and dreams. Daniel 1:17.\nThe ignorance of many is voluntary and inexcusable.26\nSome young persons ... do not improve their advantages. They\nwould like to read and write accurately, but the price of excellence\nis hard work, and they will not pay it. They remind me of the youth\nwhose father sent him to school, and gave him every advantage for\ngaining a good education; but he neglected to study, saying that his\nfather was able to give him a liberal education, and he was not going\nto bother his brains about it. You will all say at once that he would\nremain ignorant, for there is no royal road to learning. But wishing\nfor a healthy religious experience without making earnest, self-\ndenying effort, will be equally useless. Sighing over your ignorance\nof divine things will never make you wise unto salvation. There are\nten thousand sluggish tears and sighs toward heaven that will never\nwin one smile of approval from Jesus. Do not think that a Christian\nexperience will come to you of itself. When you make up your mind\nto do something on which your heart is set, you do not give up for\ndifficulties, but try again and again.27\nDaniel and his three companions ... were well-balanced because\nthey had yielded themselves to the control of the Holy Spirit. These\nyouth gave to God all the glory of their secular, scientific, and re-\nligious endowments.

But if we expect this manifestation of growing\nintelligence in the child, as he advances in years, should we not also\nexpect to see the Christian grow in grace and experience? ...\nGod has given us many advantages and opportunities, and when\nthe lastgreatday shallbe ushered in, andwe shallsee what we might\nhave attained, had we taken advantage of the helps that Heaven\nvouchsafed to us; when we see how we might have grown in grace,\nand look upon these things as God looks upon them, seeing what\nwe have lost by failing to grow up into the full stature of men and\nwomen in Christ, we shall wish that we had been more in earnest.39\nGod does not desire you to remain novices. He needs in His\nwork everything that you can gain here in the lines of mental culture\nand clear discernment. He desires to have you reach the very highest\nround of the ladder, and then step off it into the kingdom of God.\nThe Lord desires you to understand the position you occupy\nas sons and daughters of the Most High, children of the heavenly\nKing.40"

As\nsin is purged from our hearts, the light of the knowledge of the\nglory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, illuminating His word,\nand reflected from the face of nature, more and more fully will\ndeclare Him “merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant\nin goodness and truth.”\nIn His light shall we see light, until mind and heart and soul are\ntransformed into the image of His holiness.\nFor those who thus lay hold of the divine assurances of God’s\nWord, there are wonderful possibilities. Before them lie vast fields\nof truth, vast resources of power. Glorious things are to be revealed.\nPrivileges and duties which they do not even suspect to be in the\nBible will be made manifest.

As His goodness, His mercy, and His love are dwelt\nupon, clearer and still clearer will be the perception of truth; higher,\nholier, the desire for purity of heart and clearness of thought. The\nsoul dwelling in the pure atmosphere of holy thought is transformed\nby intercourse with God through the study of His Word. Truth is\nso large, so far-reaching, so deep, so broad, that self is lost sight of.\nThe heart is softened and subdued into humility, kindness, and love.\nAnd the natural powers are enlarged because of holy obedience.61"

Galatians 4:7.\nThe Galatians were given up to the worship of idols, but as\nthe apostles preached to them, they rejoiced in the message that\npromised freedom from the thraldom of sin. Paul and his fellow-\nworkers proclaimed the doctrine of righteousness by faith in the\natoning sacrifice of Christ. They presented Christ as the One who,\nseeing the helpless condition of the fallen race, came to redeem men\nand women by living a life of obedience to God’s law, and by paying\nthe penalty of disobedience. And in the light of the cross, many\nwho had never before known of the true God, began to comprehend\nthe greatness of the Father’s love. Thus the Galatians were taught\nthe fundamental truths concerning “God the Father,” and “our Lord\nJesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us\nfrom this present evil world, according to the will of God and our\nFather.” “By the hearing of faith,” they received the Spirit of God,\nand became “the children of God by faith in Christ.”\nPaul’s manner of life while among the Galatians was such that\nhe could afterward say, “I beseech you, be as I am.” His lips had\nbeen touched with a live coal from off the altar, and he was enabled\nto rise above bodily infirmities, and to present Jesus as the sinner’s\nonly hope. Those who heard him knew that he had been with Jesus.\nEndued with power from on high, he was able to compare spiritual\nthings with spiritual, and to tear down the strongholds of Satan.\nHearts were broken by this presentation of the love of God, as\nrevealed in the sacrifice of His only begotten Son, and many were\nled to inquire, What must I do to be saved? ... The cross brings us\nnear to God, reconciling us to Him. With the relenting compassion\nof a father’s love, Jehovah looks upon the suffering that His Son\nBecomeGod’sSons,andHeirsThroughChrist,December3 459\nendured in order to save the race from eternal death, and accepts us\nin the Beloved.5"

        "content": "In these words an individual work is laid out for each one of us.\nWe are to make determined efforts to overcome as Christ overcame.\nFrom this warfare no one is excused. If for us the gates of the holy\ncity swing ajar, if we behold the King in His beauty, we must now\novercome as Christ overcame.... He laid aside His robes of royalty,\n... His riches, and for our sake became poor, that we might come\ninto possession of an immortal inheritance. In our behalf, He met\nand conquered the prince of darkness....\nThe lesson of self-control should begin with the infant in its\nmother’s arms. The child should be taught that its will must be\nbrought into subjection.... Who are these children committed to our\ncare?—Theyare the youngermembers ofthe Lord’s family. He says,\nTake these children and train them ... so that they will be polished\nafter the similitude of a palace, prepared to shine in the courts of\nMy house. What an important work! ... Remember that in your\nwork the Creator of the universe will give you help. In His strength,\nand through His name, you can lead your children to be overcomers.\nTeach them to look to God for strength. Tell them that He hears their\nprayers. Teach them to overcome evil with good. Teach them to\nexertan influence thatis elevating andennobling. Leadthem to unite\nwith God, and then they will have strength to resist the strongest\ntemptation. They will then receive the reward of the overcomer.61\nYou lose much by not studying with greater earnestness and care\nthe life of Christ. There you ... may see the victories which you have\nto gain ... that you may win the precious white robe of a spotless\ncharacter, and stand at last without fault before the throne of God.62"
