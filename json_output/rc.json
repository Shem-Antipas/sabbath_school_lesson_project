        "content": "“The virgin ... will give birth to a son, and they will call him\nImmanuel”—which means, “God with us.” Matthew 1:23,\nN.I.V.\n“The light of the knowledge of the glory of God” is seen “in the\nface of Jesus Christ.” From the days of eternity the Lord Jesus Christ\nwas one with the Father; He was “the image of God,” the image of\nHis greatness and majesty, “the outshining of his glory.” It was to\nmanifest this glory that He came to our world. To this sin-darkened\nearth He came to reveal the light of God’s love—to be “God with\nus.” Therefore it was prophesied of Him, “His name shall be called\nImmanuel.”\nBy coming to dwell with us, Jesus was to reveal God both to\nmen and to angels. He was the Word of God—God’s thought made\naudible. In His prayer for His disciples He says, “I have declared\nunto them thy name”—“merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and\nabundant in goodness and truth”—“that the love wherewith Thou\nhas loved Me may be in them, and I in them.”\nBut not alone for His earthborn children was this revelation\ngiven. Our little world is the lesson book of the universe. God’s\nwonderful purpose of grace, the mystery of redeeming love, is the\ntheme into which, “angels desire to look,” and it will be their study\nthroughout endless ages. Both the redeemed and the unfallen beings\nwill find in the cross of Christ their science and their song. It will be\nseen that the glory shining in the face of Jesus is the glory of self-\nsacrificing love. In the light from Calvary it will be seen that the law\nof self-renouncing love is the law of life for earth and heaven; that\nthe love which “seeketh not her own” has its source in the heart of\nGod; and that in the meek and lowly One is manifested the character\nof Him who dwelleth in the light which no man can approach unto....\nWe behold God in Jesus. Looking unto Jesus we see that it is the\nglory of our God to give. “I do nothing of myself,” said Christ; “the"

Hebrews\n2:9.\nThe Lord created man pure and holy. But Satan led him\nastray, perverting his principles and corrupting his mind, turning his\nthoughts into a wrong channel. His purpose was to make the world\nwholly corrupt.\nChrist saw man’s fearful danger, and He determined to save him\nby the sacrifice of Himself. That He might accomplish His purpose\nof love for the fallen race, He became bone of our bone and flesh\nof our flesh. “As the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he\nalso himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he\nmight destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and\ndeliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject\nto bondage....

Christ, theredeemer\nand restorer, was to sanctify and purify man’s mind, making it a\npower that would draw other minds to Himself. It is His purpose,\nby the elevating, sanctifying power of the truth, to give men nobility\nand dignity. He desires His children to reveal His character, to exert\nHis influence, that other minds may be drawn into harmony with\nHis mind....\nChrist might, because of our guilt, have moved far away from\nus. But instead of moving farther away, He came and dwelt among\nChristSacrificedHimselfForUs,January3 23\nus, filled with all the fullness of the Godhead, to be one with us, that\nthrough His grace we might attain perfection. By a death of shame\nand suffering He paid our ransom. From the highest excellency He\ncame, His divinity clothed with humanity, descending step by step\nto the lowest depths of humiliation. No line can measure the depth\nof His love....\nI marvel that professing Christians do not grasp the divine re-\nsources, that they do not see the cross more clearly as the medium\nof forgiveness and pardon, the means of bringing the proud, selfish\nheart of man into direct contact with the Holy Spirit, that the riches\nof Christ may be poured into the mind, and the human agent be\nadorned with the graces of the Spirit, that Christ may be commended\nto those who know Him not.—The Signs of the Times, September\n24, 1902."

It is that faith\nwhich makes Christ your own personal Saviour—that faith which,\nrecognizing your helplessness, your utter inability to save yourself,\ntakes hold of the Helper who is mighty to save, as your only hope.\nIt is faith that will not be discouraged, that hears the voice of Christ\nsaying, “Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world, and My\ndivine strength is yours.” It is the faith that hears Him say, “Lo, I am\nwith you alway, even unto the end of the world.”\nThe reason why the churches are weak and sickly and ready to\ndie is that the enemy has brought influences of a discouraging nature\nto bear upon trembling souls. He has sought to shut Jesus from\ntheir view as the Comforter, as one who reproves, who warns, who\nadmonishes them, saying, “This is the way, walk ye in it.” Christ\nhas all power in heaven and in earth, and He can strengthen the\nwavering, and set right the erring.

Whoever consents to renounce sin and open\nhis heart to the love of Christ becomes a partaker of this heavenly\npeace.\nThere is no other ground of peace than this. The grace of Christ,\nreceived into the heart, subdues enmity; it allays strife and fills\nthe soul with love. He who is at peace with God and his fellow\nmen cannot be made miserable. Envy will not be in his heart; evil\nsurmisings will find no room there; hatred cannot exist. The heart\nthat is in harmony with God is a partaker of the peace of heaven and\nwill diffuse its blessed influence on all around. The spirit of peace\nwill rest like dew upon hearts weary and troubled with worldly strife.\nChrist’s followers are sent to the world with the message of\npeace. Whoever, by the quiet, unconscious influence of a holy life,\nshall reveal the love of Christ; whoever, by word or deed, shall lead\nanother to renounce sin and yield his heart to God, is a peacemaker.\nAnd “blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the\nchildren of God.” The spirit of peace is evidence of their connection\nwith heaven. The sweet savor of Christ surrounds them. The fra-\ngrance of the life, the loveliness of the character, reveal to the world\nthe fact that they are children of God. Men take knowledge of them\nthat they have been with Jesus....\n“And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people\nas a dew from the Lord, as the showers upon the grass” (Micah\n5:7).—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, 27, 28.\nWhenIsaiahforetoldthebirthoftheMessiah, heascribedtoHim\nthe title, “Prince ofPeace.” When angels announcedto the shepherds\nChrist“ThePrinceofPeace”,January24 65\nthat Christ was born, they sang above the plains of Bethlehem:\n“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward\nmen” (Luke 2:14).\nThere is a seeming contradiction between these prophetic dec-\nlarations and the words of Christ: “I came not to send peace, but\na sword” (Matthew 10:34). But, rightly understood, the two are in\nperfect harmony. The gospel is a message of peace. Christianity is a\nsystem which, received and obeyed, would spread peace, harmony,\nand happiness throughout the earth.

As a personal Saviour He ascended on high. As a personal\nSaviour He intercedes in the heavenly courts. Before the throne\nof God in our behalf ministers “one like unto the Son of man”\n(Revelation 1:13).\nChrist, the Light of the world, veiled the dazzling splendor of\nHis divinity and came to live as a man among men, that they might,\nwithout being consumed, become acquainted with their Creator.\nSince sin brought separation between man and his Maker, no man\nhas seen God at any time, except as He is manifested through Christ.\n“I and my Father are one,” Christ declared (John 10:30). “No\nman knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the\nFather, save the Son and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him”\n(John 10:30; Matthew 11:27).\nChrist came to teach human beings what God desires them to\nknow. In the heavens above, in the earth, in the broad waters of\nthe ocean, we see the handiwork of God. All created things testify\nto His power, His wisdom, His love. Yet not from the stars or the\nocean or the cataract can we learn of the personality of God as it\nwas revealed in Christ.\nGod saw that a clearer revelation than nature was needed to\nportray both His personality and His character. He sent His Son into\nthe world to manifest, so far as could be endured by human sight,\nthe nature and the attributes of the invisible God....\nTaking humanity upon Him, Christ came to be one with hu-\nmanity, and at the same time to reveal our heavenly Father to sinful\nhuman beings. He who had been in the presence of the Father from\nPersonalityofGodRevealedinChrist,January25 67\nthe beginning, He who was the express image of the invisible God,\nwas alone able to reveal the character of the Deity to mankind. He\nwas in all things made like unto His brethren. He became flesh even\nas we are. He was hungry and thirsty and weary. He was sustained\nby food and refreshed by sleep. He shared the lot of men; yet He was\nthe blameless Son of God.... Tender, compassionate, sympathetic,\never considerate of others, He represented the character of God, and\nwas constantly engaged in service for God and man.—The Ministry\nof Healing, 418-423.\nThe theme of redemption will employ the minds and tongues\nof the redeemed through everlasting ages.

        "content": "Sin originated in self-seeking. Lucifer, the covering cherub,\ndesired to be first in heaven. He sought to gain control of heavenly\nbeings, to draw them away from their Creator, and to win their\nhomage to himself. Therefore he misrepresented God, attributing to\nHim the desire for self-exaltation. With his own evil characteristics\nhe sought to invest the loving Creator. Thus he deceived angels.\nThus he deceived men. He led them to doubt the word of God,\nand to distrust His goodness. Because God is a God of justice and\nterrible majesty, Satan caused them to look upon Him as severe and\nunforgiving. Thus he drew men to join him in rebellion against God,\nand the night of woe settled down upon the world.\nThe earth was dark through misapprehension of God. That\nthe gloomy shadows might be lightened, that the world might be\nbrought back to God, Satan’s deceptive power was to be broken.\nThis could not be done by force. The exercise of force is contrary to\nthe principles of God’s government; He desires only the service of\nlove; and love cannot be commanded; it cannot be won by force or\nauthority. Only by love is love awakened. To know God is to love\nHim; His character must be manifested in contrast to the character of\nSatan. This work only one Being in all the universe could do. Only\nHe who knew the height and depth of the love of God could make it\nknown. Upon the world’s dark night the Sun of Righteousness must\nrise, “with healing in his wings” (Malachi 4:2).\nThe plan for our redemption was not an afterthought, a plan\nformulated after the fall of Adam. It was a revelation of “the mystery\nwhich hath been kept in silence through times eternal” (Romans\n16:25, R.V.). It was an unfolding of the principles that from eternal\nages have been the foundation of God’s throne. From the beginning,\nChristBridgedtheGulfCausedbySin,January9 35\nGod and Christ knew of the apostasy of Satan, and of the fall of man\nthrough the deceptive power of the apostate. God did not ordain that\nsin should exist, but He foresaw its existence, and made provision to\nmeet the terrible emergency....\nSince Jesus came to dwell with us, we know that God is ac-\nquainted with our trials, and sympathizes with our griefs. Every son\nand daughter of Adam may understand that our Creator is the friend\nof sinners. For in every doctrine of grace, every promise of joy,\nevery deed of love, every divine attraction presented in the Saviour’s\nlife on earth, we see “God with us.”—The Desire of Ages, 21-24.\n[24] The Image of the Divine to Shine Through, January\nBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven\nis perfect. Matthew 5:48.\nThe ideal of Christian character is Christlikeness. As the Son\nof man was perfect in His life, so His followers are to be perfect in\ntheir life. Jesus was in all things made like unto His brethren. He\nbecame flesh, even as we are. He was hungry and thirsty and weary.\nHe was sustained by food and refreshed by sleep. He shared the lot\nof man; yet He was the blameless Son of God. He was God in the\nflesh. His character is to be ours....\nChrist is the ladder that Jacob saw, the base resting on the earth,\nand the topmost round reaching to the gate of heaven, to the very\nthreshold of glory. If that ladder had failed by a single step of\nreaching the earth, we should have been lost. But Christ reaches us\nwhere we are. He took our nature and overcame, that we through\ntaking His nature might overcome. Made “in the likeness of sinful\nflesh” (Romans 8:3), He lived a sinless life. Now by His divinity\nHe lays hold upon the throne of heaven, while by His humanity He\nreaches us. He bids us by faith in Him attain to the glory of the\ncharacter of God. Therefore are we to be perfect, even as our “Father\nwhich is in heaven is perfect.”\nJesus had shown in what righteousness consists, and had pointed\nto God as its source. Now He turned to practical duties. In alms-\ngiving, in prayer, in fasting, He said, let nothing be done to attract\nattention or win praise to self. Give in sincerity, for the benefit of the\nsuffering poor. In prayer, let the soul commune with God. In fasting,\ngo not with the head bowed down, and heart filled with thoughts of\nself.... It is he who yields himself most unreservedly to God that\nwill render Him the most acceptable service. For through fellowship\nwith God men become workers together with Him in presenting His\ncharacter in humanity."

The spiritual healing was followed by physical restoration.\nThis lesson should not be overlooked. There are today thousands\nsuffering from physical disease, who, like the paralytic, are longing\nfor the message, “Thy sins are forgiven.” The burden of sin, with its\nunrest and unsatisfied desires, is the foundation of their maladies.\nThey can find no relief until they come to the Healer of the soul. The\npeace which He alone can give would impart vigor to the mind, and\nhealth to the body.\nJesus came to “destroy the works of the devil.” “In him was life,”\nand He says, “I am come that they might have life, and that they\nmight have it more abundantly.” He is “a quickening spirit.” And\nHe still has the same life-giving power as when on earth He healed\nthe sick and spoke forgiveness to the sinner. He “forgiveth all thine\niniquities,” He “healeth all thy diseases.”\nThe effect produced upon the people by the healing of the par-\nalytic was as if heaven has opened, and revealed the glories of the\nbetter world. As the man who had been cured passed through the\nmultitude, blessing God at every step, and bearing his burden as if it\nwere a feather’s weight, the people fell back to give him room, and\nwith awe-stricken faces gazed upon him, whispering softly among\nthemselves, “We have seen strange things today.” ...\nIn the home of the healed paralytic there was great rejoicing....\nHe stood before them in the full vigor of manhood. Those arms that\nthey had seen lifeless were quick to obey his will. The flesh that\nChristBroughtSpiritualandPhysicalHealing,January11 39\nhad been shrunken and leaden-hued was now fresh and ruddy. He\nwalked with a firm, free step. Joy and hope were written in every\nlineament of his countenance; and an expression of purity and peace\nhad taken the place of marks of sin and suffering. Glad thanksgiving\nwent up from that home, and God was glorified through His Son,\nwho had restored hope to the hopeless, and strength to the stricken\none. This man and his family were ready to lay down their lives\nfor Jesus.

Andtheystraightway\nleft their nets, and followed him.” ...\nThe prompt, unquestioning obedience of these men, with no\npromise of wages, seems remarkable; but the words of Christ were\nan invitation that carried with it an impelling power.

By the simplicity of\nfaith, by pure, humble service, the disciples were taught to carry\nresponsibilities in God’s cause.\nThere are lessons for us to learn from the experience of the\napostles. These men were as true as steel to principle. They were\nmen who would not fail nor be discouraged. They were full of\nreverence and zeal for God, full of noble purposes and aspirations.\nThey were by nature as weak and helpless as any of those now\nengaged in the work, but they put their whole trust in the Lord.\nWealth they had, but it consisted of mind and soul culture; and this\nevery one may have who will make God first and last and best in\neverything.

Both the men who\nwere crucified with Jesus had at first railed upon Him; and one under\nhis suffering only became more desperate and defiant.\nBut not so with his companion. This man was not a hardened\ncriminal; he had been led astray by evil associations, but he was less\nguilty than many of those who stood beside the cross reviling the\nSaviour. He had seen and heard Jesus, and had been convicted by\nHis teaching, but he had been turned away from Him by the priests\nand rulers. Seeking to stifle conviction, he had plunged deeper\nand deeper into sin, until he was arrested, tried as a criminal, and\ncondemned to die on the cross.\nIn the judgment hall and on the way to Calvary he had been in\ncompany with Jesus. He had heard Pilate declare, “I find no fault\nin Him” (John 19:4). He had marked His Godlike bearing, and His\npitying forgiveness of His tormentors. On the cross he sees the many\ngreat religionists shoot out the tongue with scorn, and ridicule the\nLord Jesus. He sees the wagging heads. He hears the upbraiding\nspeeches taken up by his companion in guilt: “If thou be Christ, save\nthyself and us.”\nAmong the passersby he hears many defending Jesus. He hears\nthem repeat His words, and tell of His works. The conviction comes\nback to him that this is the Christ.... And now, all sin-polluted as\nit is, his life history is about to close. “And we indeed justly,” he\nmoans; “for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man\nhath done nothing amiss.” ...\nStrange, tender thoughts now spring up. He calls to mind all he\nhas heard of Jesus, how He has healed the sick and pardoned sin....\nThe Holy Spirit illuminates his mind, and little by little the chain of\nChrist’sGloryShinesOnTheThief,January20 57\nevidence is joined together. In Jesus, bruised, mocked, and hanging\nupon the cross, he sees the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of\nthe world. Hope is mingled with anguish in his voice as the helpless,\ndying soul casts himself upon a dying Saviour. “Lord, remember\nme,” he cries, “when thou comest into thy kingdom.”\nQuickly the answer came. Soft and melodious the tone, full of\nlove, compassion, and power the words: Verily I say unto thee today,\nThou shalt be with Me in paradise....\nWith longing heart He has listened for some expression of faith\nfrom His disciples.... How grateful then to the Saviour was the\nutterance of faith and love from the dying thief!—The Desire of\nAges, 749, 750.\n[35] As Our Example Christ Is All And In All, January\nIn him was life; and the life was the light of men. John 1:4.\nThe ethics inculcated by the gospel acknowledge no standard\nbut the perfection of God’s mind, God’s will. God requires from His\ncreatures conformity to His will. Imperfection of character is sin,\nand sin is the transgression of the law. All righteous attributes of\ncharacter dwell in God as a perfect, harmonious whole. Everyone\nwho receives Christ as his personal Saviour is privileged to possess\nthese attributes. This is the science of holiness.\nHow glorious are the possibilities set before the fallen race!\nThrough His Son, God has revealed the excellency to which man is\ncapable of attaining. Through the merits of Christ, man is lifted from\nhis depraved state, purified, and made more precious than the golden\nwedge of Ophir. It is possible for him to become a companion of the\nangels in glory, and to reflect the image of Jesus Christ, shining even\nin the bright splendor of the eternal throne. It is his privilege to have\nfaith that through the power of Christ he shall be made immortal.\nYet how seldom he realizes to what heights he could attain if he\nwould allow God to direct his every step!\nGod permits every human being to exercise his individuality.\nHe desires no one to submerge his mind in the mind of a fellow\nmortal. Those who desire to be transformed in mind and character\nare not to look to men, but to the divine Example. God gives the\ninvitation, “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.”\nBy conversion and transformation, men are to receive the mind\nof Christ. Every one is to stand before God with an individual\nfaith, an individual experience, knowing for himself that Christ is\nformed within, the hope of glory. For us to imitate the example\nof any man—even one whom we might regard as nearly perfect in\ncharacter—would be to put our trust in a defective human being, one\nwho is unable to impart a jot or tittle of perfection."

These theories are both false in\ndoctrine and dangerous in practical results; and the fact that they are\nso generally finding favor renders it doubly essential that all have a\nclear understanding of what the Scriptures teach upon this point.\nTrue sanctification is a Bible doctrine. The apostle Paul, in his\nletter to the Thessalonian church, declares: “This is the will of God,\neven your sanctification.” And he prays: “The very God of peace\nsanctify you wholly” (1 Thessalonians 4:3; 5:23). The Bible clearly\nteaches what sanctification is and how it is to be attained. The\nSaviour prayed for His disciples: “Sanctify them through thy truth:\nthy word is truth” (John 17:17). And Paul teaches that believers are\nto be “sanctified by the Holy Ghost” (Romans 15:16).\nWhat is the work of the Holy Spirit? Jesus told His disciples:\n“When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all\ntruth” (John 16:13). And the psalmist says: “Thy law is the truth.” ...\nAndsince the lawofGodis “holy, andjust, andgood,” a transcriptof\nthe divine perfection, it follows that a characterformed by obedience\nto that law will be holy.\nChrist is a perfect example of such a character.

The followers of Christ are to be-\ncome like Him—by the grace of God to form characters in harmony\nwith the principles of His holy law. This is Bible sanctification.\nThis work can be accomplished only through faith in Christ, by\nthe power of the indwelling Spirit of God.

        "content": "The Lord was pleased, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify\nhis law and make it glorious. Isaiah 42:21, R.S.V.\nThrough the devices of the great apostate, man has been led to\nseparate himself from God, and has yielded to the temptations of the\nadversary of God and man in committing sin and breaking the law of\nthe Most High. God could not alter one jot or tittle of His holy law\nto meet man in his fallen condition; for this would reflect discredit\nupon the wisdom of God in making a law by which to govern heaven\nand earth. But God could give His only-begotten Son to become\nman’s substitute and surety, to suffer the penalty that was merited\nby the transgressor, and to impart to the repentant soul His perfect\nrighteousness.\nChrist became the sinless sacrifice for a guilty race, making men\nprisoners of hope, so that, through repentance toward God because\nthey had broken His holy law, and through faith in Christ as their\nsubstitute, surety, and righteousness, they might be brought back to\nloyalty to God and to obedience to His holy law....\nThe life and death of Christ in behalf of sinful man were for the\npurpose of restoring the sinner to God’s favor, through imparting to\nhim the righteousness that would meet the claims of the law, and\nfind acceptance with the Father. But it is ever the purpose of Satan\nto make void the law of God, and to pervert the true meaning of the\nplan of salvation. Therefore he has originated the falsehood that the\nsacrifice of Christ on Calvary’s cross was for the purpose of freeing\nmen from the obligation of keeping the commandments of God. He\nhas foisted upon the world the deception that God has abolished His\nconstitution, thrown away His moral standard, and made void His\nholy and perfect law. Had He done this, at what terrible expense\nwould it have been to Heaven!\nInstead of proclaiming the abolition of the law, Calvary’s cross\nproclaims in thunder tones its immutable and eternal character.\nChristCameToMagnifyHisLaw,February8 97\nCould the law have been abolished, and the government of heaven\nand earth and the unnumbered worlds of God maintained, Christ\nneed not have died. The death of Christ was to forever settle the\nquestion of the validity of the law of Jehovah. Having suffered the\nfull penalty for a guilty world, Jesus became the mediator between\nGod and man, to restore the repenting soul to favor with God by\ngiving him grace to keep the law of the Most High.\nChrist came not to destroy the law or the prophets, but to fulfill\nthem to the very letter. The atonement of Calvary vindicated the law\nof God as holy, just, and true, not only before the fallen world, but\nbefore heaven and before worlds unfallen.—The Signs of the Times,"

        "content": "The desire for an easy religion that requires no striving, no\nself-denial, no divorce from the follies of the world, has made the\ndoctrine of faith, and faith only, a popular doctrine; but what saith\nthe Word of God? Says the apostle James: “What doth it profit, my\nbrethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can\nfaith save him? ... Wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without\nworks is dead? Was notAbraham ourfatherjustifiedbyworks, when\nhe had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou how faith\nwrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?... Ye\nsee then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only”\n(James 2:14-24).\nThe testimony of the Word of God is against this ensnaring\ndoctrine of faith without works. It is not faith that claims the favor of\nHeaven without complying with the conditions upon which mercy is\nto be granted, it is presumption; for genuine faith has its foundation\nin the promises and provisions of the Scriptures....\nThe commission of a known sin silences the witnessing voice of\nthe Spirit and separates the soul from God. “Sin is the transgression\nof the law.” And “whosoever sinneth [transgresseth the law] hath\nnot seen him, neither known him” (1 John 3:6). Though John in\nhis Epistles dwells so fully upon love, yet he does not hesitate to\nreveal the true character of that class who claim to be sanctified\nwhile living in transgression of the law of God. “He that saith, I\nknow him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the\ntruth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the\nlove of God perfected” (chap. 2:4, 5).\nHere is the test of every man’s profession. We cannot accord\nholiness to any man without bringing him to the measurement of\nGod’s only standard of holiness in heaven and in earth. If men feel\nno weight of the moral law, if they belittle and make light of God’s\nTrueFollowersObeyGod’sLaw,February4 89\nprecepts, if they break one of the least of these commandments, and\nteach men so, they shall be of no esteem in the sight of Heaven, and\nwe may know that their claims are without foundation.\nAnd the claim to be without sin is, in itself, evidence that he\nwho makes this claim is far from holy. It is because he has no true\nconception of the infinite purity and holiness of God or of what they\nmust become who shall be in harmony with His character; because\nhe has no true conception of the purity and exalted loveliness of\nJesus, and the malignity and evil of sin, that man can regard himself\nas holy.—The Great Controversy, 472, 473.\nIt was the righteousness revealed in His [Christ’s] life that dis-\ntinguished Him from the world.—The Upward Look, 303."

Christ would reach\nto the depths of misery to rescue the ruined race.—Patriarchs and\nProphets, 63.\nThe plan of redemption had a yet broader and deeper purpose\nthan the salvation of man. It was not for this alone that Christ came\nto the earth; it was not merely that the inhabitants of this little world\nmight regard the law of God as it should be regarded; but it was to\nvindicate the character of God before the universe. To this result\nof His great sacrifice—its influence upon the intelligences of other\nworlds, as well as upon man—the Saviour looked forward when just\nbefore His crucifixion He said: “Now is the judgment of this world:\nnow shall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up\nfrom the earth, will draw all men unto me.”\nThe act of Christ in dying for the salvation of man would not\nonly make heaven accessible to men, but before all the universe it\nwould justify God and His Son in their dealing with the rebellion\nof Satan. It would establish the perpetuity of the law of God, and\nwould reveal the nature and the results of sin.\nFrom the first the great controversy had been upon the law of\nGod.

        "content": "God presented him [Christ Jesus] as a sacrifice of atonement,\nthrough faith in his blood.... He did it to demonstrate his\njustice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who\njustifies the man who has faith in Jesus. Romans 3:25, 26,\nN.I.V.\n“Being justified freely by his grace,” the apostle Paul says,\n“through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath\nset forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare\nhis righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the\nforbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness:\nthat he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in\nJesus.”\nHere the truth is laid out in plain lines. This mercy and goodness\nis wholly undeserved. The grace of Christ is freely to justify the\nsinner without merit or claim on his part. Justification is a full,\ncomplete pardon of sin. The moment a sinner accepts Christ by\nfaith, that moment he is pardoned. The righteousness of Christ is\nimputed to him, and he is no more to doubt God’s forgiving grace.\nThere is nothing in faith that makes it our saviour. Faith cannot\nremove our guilt. Christ is the power of God unto salvation to all\nthem that believe. The justification comes through the merits of\nJesus Christ. He has paid the price for the sinner’s redemption. Yet it\nis only through faith in His blood that Jesus can justify the believer.\nThe sinner cannot depend upon his own good works as a means\nof justification. He must come to the point where he will renounce\nall his sin, and embrace one degree of light after another, as it shines\nupon his pathway. He simply grasps by faith the free and ample\nprovision made in the blood of Christ. He believes the promises\nof God which through Christ are made unto him sanctification and\nrighteousness and redemption."

We need a\nchildlike simplicity that will lead us to tell the Lord all our wants,\nand believe that according to His riches and goodness and love He\nwill satisfy our needs. “If ye shall ask any thing in my name,” He\nsays, “I will do it.” If you love Me, you will show that love by\nkeeping My commandments. “And I will pray the Father, and he\nshall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for\never; even the Spirit of truth.” ...\n“He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is\nthat loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father,\nand I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.” This is the\nonly true test of character.

The\noft-repeated words of love for God are of no value unless that love\nis made manifest in the life practice. Love for God is not a mere\nsentiment; it is a living, working power. The man who does the will\nof his Father who is in heaven shows to the world that he loves God.\nThe fruit of his love is seen in good works....\nThe apostle James saw that dangers would arise in presenting the\nsubject of justification by faith, and he labored to show that genuine\nfaith cannot exist without corresponding works.

And when this work is wrought in\nus, we shall claim no righteousness of our own, but shall exalt Jesus\nChrist, while we hang our helpless souls upon His merits.\nOur Saviour ever condemned self-righteousness.

If they should perform good deeds to be lauded by men,\nno reward would be given them by their Father in heaven.\nThe followers of Christ were instructed not to pray for the pur-\npose of being heard of men. “But thou, when thou prayest, enter\ninto thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father\nwhich is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward\nthee openly” (Matthew 6:6).

He taught that the Christian must be\npure in heart and life. Never should he be satisfied with an empty\nprofession. As God is holy in His sphere, so fallen man, through\nfaith in Christ, is to be holy in his sphere....\nThe sanctification of the church is God’s object in all His deal-\nings with His people. He has chosen them from eternity, that they\nmight be holy. He gave His Son to die for them, that they might be\nsanctified through obedience to the truth, divested of all the little-\nness of self. From them He requires a personal work, a personal\nsurrender. God can be honored by those who profess to believe in\nHim, only as they are conformed to His image and controlled by His\nSpirit. Then, as witnesses for the Saviour, they may make known\nwhat divine grace has done for them.\nTrue sanctification comes through the working out of the prin-\nciple of love. “God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth\nin God, and God in him” (chap. 4:16). The life of him in whose\nheart Christ abides, will reveal practical godliness. The character\nwill be purified, elevated, ennobled, and glorified.

Daniel 1:3, 4, N.I.V.\nThe prophet Daniel was an illustrious character. He was a bright\nexample of what men may become when united with the God of\nwisdom. A brief account of the life of this holy man of God is left\non record for the encouragement of those who should afterward be\ncalled to endure trial and temptation.\nWhen the people of Israel, their king, nobles, and priests were\ncarried into captivity, four of their number were selected to serve\nin the court of the king of Babylon. One of these was Daniel,\nwho early gave promise of the remarkable ability developed in later\nyears. These youth were all of princely birth, and are described as\n“children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in\nall wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science,\nand such as had ability in them” (Daniel 1:4).\nPerceiving the superior talents of these youthful captives, King\nNebuchadnezzar determined to prepare them to fill important posi-\ntions in his kingdom. That they might be fully qualified for their life\nat court, according to Oriental custom, they were to be taught the\nlanguage of the Chaldeans, and to be subjected for three years to a\nthorough course of physical and intellectual discipline.\nThe youth in this school of training were not only to be admitted\nto the royal palace, but it was provided that they should eat of the\nmeat and drink of the wine which came from the king’s table....\nAmong the viands placed before the king were swine’s flesh and\nother meats which were declared unclean by the law of Moses, and\nwhich the Hebrews had been expressly forbidden to eat. Here Daniel\nwas brought to a severe test. Should he adhere to the teachings\nDanielStandsFirmWhateverTheResult,March12 163\nof his fathers concerning meats and drinks, and offend the king,\nand probably lose not only his position but his life? or should he\ndisregard the commandment of the Lord and retain the favor of\nthe king, thus securing great intellectual advantages and the most\nflattering worldly prospects?\nDaniel did not long hesitate. He decided to stand firm in his\nintegrity, let the result be what it might. He “purposed in his heart\nthat he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat,\nnor with the wine which he drank” (verse 8).... He made God his\nstrength, and the fear of God was continually before him in all the\ntransactions of his life.—The Sanctified Life, 18-20."

The clearer their views of the greatness, glory, and perfection\nof Christ, the more vividly will they see their own weakness and\nimperfection. They will have no disposition to claim a sinless char-\nacter; that which has appeared right and comely in themselves will,\nin contrast with Christ’s purity and glory, appear only as unworthy\nand corruptible. It is when men are separated from God, when they\nhave very indistinct views of Christ, that they say, “I am sinless; I\nam sanctified.”\nGabriel now appeared to the prophet, and thus addressed him:\n“O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak\nunto thee” (verse 11).... What great honor is shown to Daniel by the\nMajesty of heaven! He comforts His trembling servant and assures\nhim that his prayer has been heard in heaven. In answer to that\nfervent petition the angel Gabriel was sent to affect the heart of the\nPersian king. The monarch had resisted the impressions of the Spirit\nof God during the three weeks while Daniel was fasting and praying,\nbut heaven’s Prince, the Archangel, Michael, was sent to turn the\nheart of the stubborn king to take some decided action to answer the\nprayer of Daniel.\n“And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face\ntoward the ground, and I became dumb. And, behold, one like the\nsimilitude of the sons of men touched my lips.... And said, O man\ngreatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be\nstrong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and\nGodAnswersDaniel’sFerventPrayer,March17 173\nsaid, Let my Lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me” (verse\n15-19).\nSo great was the divine glory revealed to Daniel that he could\nnot endure the sight. Then the messenger of heaven veiled the\nbrightness of his presence and appeared to the prophet as “one like\nthe similitude of the sons of men” (verse 16). By his divine power he\nstrengthened this man of integrity and of faith, to hear the message\nsent to him from God.\nDaniel was a devoted servant of the Most High. His long life was\nfilled up with noble deeds of service for his Master. His purity of\ncharacterandunwavering fidelity are equaled only by his humility of\nheart and his contrition before God. We repeat, the life of Daniel is\nan inspired illustration of true sanctification.—The Sanctified Life,\n50-52."

His\nlong life was filled with noble service for his Master. He was a man\n“greatly beloved” (Daniel 10:11) of Heaven. Yet instead of claiming\nto be pure and holy, this honored prophet identified himself with\nthe really sinful of Israel as he pleaded before God in behalf of his\npeople: “We do not present our supplications before thee for our\nrighteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.” “We have sinned, we\nhave done wickedly” (chap. 9:18, 15)....\nWhen Job heard the voice of the Lord out of the whirlwind, he\nexclaimed: “I abhormyself, andrepentin dustandashes” (Job42:6).\nItwas when Isaiahsawthe gloryofthe Lord, andheardthe cherubim\ncrying, “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts,” that he cried out,\n“Woe is me! for I am undone” (Isaiah 6:3, 5).

They feel that it was their sin which caused the agony that\nbroke the heart of the Son of God, and this thought will lead them to\nself-abasement.

He seemed to have enjoyed, in\na preeminent sense, the friendship of Christ, and he received many\ntokens of the Saviour’s confidence and love. He was one of the three\npermitted to witness Christ’s glory upon the mount of transfiguration\nand His agony in Gethsemane; and to the care of John our Lord\nconfided His mother in those last hours of anguish upon the cross.\nThe Saviour’s affection for the beloved disciple was returned\nwith all the strength of ardent devotion.

He esteemeditthe highest\nhonor to work and suffer in the service of his Lord. His love for\nJesus led him to love all for whom Christ died. His religion was\nof a practical character. He reasoned that love to God would be\nmanifested in love to His children. “We love him, because he first\nloved us. If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar:\nfor he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he\nlove God whom he hath not seen?” (1 John 4:19, 20).

Do we urge Jesus to take up His\nabode in our hearts and in our homes? He is full of love, of grace,\nof blessing, and stands ready to bestow these gifts upon us; but, like\nthe Samaritans, we are often content without them.\nThe disciples were aware of the purpose of Christ to bless the\nSamaritans with His presence; and when they saw the coldness,\njealousy, and disrespect shown to their Master, they were filled\nwith surprise and indignation.

The Sabbath\nwas as sacredly observed by John upon the Isle of Patmos as when\nhe was among the people, preaching upon that day. By the barren\nrocks surrounding him, John was remindedofrockyHoreb, andhow,\nwhen God spoke His law to the people there, He said, “Remember\nthe sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8).\nThe Son of God spoke to Moses from the mountaintop. God\nmade the rocks His sanctuary. His temple was the everlasting hills.\nThe Divine Legislator descended upon the rocky mountain to speak\nHis law in the hearing of all the people, that they might be impressed\nby the grand and awful exhibition of His power and glory, and fear\nto transgress His commandments. God spoke His law amid thunders\nand lightnings and the thick cloud upon the top of the mountain, and\nHis voice was as the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud. The law of\nJehovah was unchangeable, and the tablets upon which He wrote\nthat law were solid rock, signifying the immutability of His precepts.\nRocky Horeb became a sacred place to all who loved and revered\nthe law of God.\nWhile John was contemplating the scenes of Horeb, the Spirit\nof Him who sanctified the seventh day came upon him. He con-\ntemplated the sin of Adam in transgressing the divine law, and the\nfearful result of that transgression. The infinite love of God, in giv-\ning His Son to redeem a lost race, seemed too great for language\nto express. As he presents it in his Epistle he calls upon the church\nand the world to behold it. “Behold, what manner of love the Father\nhath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God:\ntherefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not” (1\nJohn 3:1).\nAmazedAtGod’sLove,March22 183\nIt was a mystery to John that God could give His Son to die\nfor rebellious man.

        "content": "The character of the Christian is shown by his daily life. Said\nChrist, “Every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree\nbringeth forth evil fruit” (Matthew 7:17). Our Saviour compares\nHimself to a vine, of which His followers are the branches. He\nplainly declares that all who would be His disciples must bring forth\nfruit; and then He shows how they may become fruitful branches.\n“Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,\nexcept it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me”\n(John 15:4).\nThe apostle Paul describes the fruit which the Christian is to\nbear. He says that it “is in all goodness and righteousness and\ntruth” (Ephesians 5:9). And again, “The fruit of the Spirit is love,\njoy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,\ntemperance” (Galatians 5:22, 23). These precious graces are but the\nprinciples of God’s law carried out in the life.\nThe law of God is the only true standard of moral perfection.\nThat law was practically exemplified in the life of Christ. He says of\nHimself, “I have kept my Father’s commandments” (John 15:10).\nNothing short of this obedience will meet the requirements of God’s\nWord. “He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to\nwalk, even as he walked” (1 John 2:6). We cannot plead that we are\nunable to do this, for we have the assurance, “My grace is sufficient\nfor thee” (2 Corinthians 12:9). As we look into the divine mirror,\nthe law of God, we see the exceeding sinfulness of sin, and our own\nlost condition as transgressors. But by repentance and faith we are\njustified before God, and through divine grace enabled to render\nobedience to His commandments.\nThose who have genuine love for God will manifest an earnest\ndesire to know His will and to do it.... The child who loves his\nLoveIsShownByWillingObedience,March23 185\nparents will show that love by willing obedience; but the selfish,\nungrateful child seeks to do as little as possible for his parents, while\nhe at the same time desires to enjoy all the privileges granted to the\nobedient and faithful.\nThe same difference is seen among those who profess to be\nchildren of God. Many who know that they are the objects of His\nlove and care, and who desire to receive His blessing, take no delight\nin doing His will. They regard God’s claims upon them as an\nunpleasant restraint, His commandments as a grievous yoke. But\nhe who is truly seeking for holiness of heart and life delights in the\nlaw of God, and mourns only that he falls so far short of meeting its\nrequirements.—The Sanctified Life, 80, 81."

But when the Christian\nregards himself as only a humble instrument in the hands of Christ,\nand endeavors to faithfully perform every duty, relying upon the\nhelp which God has promised, then he will wear the yoke of Christ\nand find it easy; then he will bear burdens for Christ, and pronounce\nthem light. He can look up with courage and with confidence, and\nsay, “I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able\nto keep that which I have committed unto him” (2 Timothy 1:12).\nIf we meet obstacles in our path, and faithfully overcome them;\nif we encounter opposition and reproach, and in Christ’s name gain\nthe victory; if we bear responsibilities and discharge our duties in\nthe spirit of our Master—then, indeed, we gain a precious knowl-\nedge of His faithfulness and power.

He said: “I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of\nthe world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. They\nare not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them\nthrough thy truth: thy word is truth.” ...\nThe burden of Jesus’ request was that those who believed on\nHim might be kept from the evil of the world, and be sanctified\nthrough the truth. He does not leave us to vague surmising as to\nwhat the truth is, but adds, “Thy word is truth.” The Word of God is\nthe means by which our sanctification is to be accomplished. It is of\nthe greatest importance, then, that we acquaint ourselves with the\nsacred instruction of the Bible.\nIt is as necessary for us to understand the words of life as it\nwas for the early disciples to be informed concerning the plan of\nsalvation. We shall be inexcusable if, through our own negligence,\nwe are ignorant of the claims of God’s Word. God has given us His\nWord, the revelation of His will, and has promised the Holy Spirit to\nthem that ask Him, to guide them into all truth; and every soul who\nhonestly desires to do the will of God shall know of the doctrine....\nThe mission of Jesus was demonstrated by convincing miracles.\nHis doctrine astonished the people.... It was a system of truth that\nmet the wants of the heart. His teaching was plain, clear, and com-\nprehensive. The practical truths He uttered had a convincing power,\nand arrested the attention of the people. Multitudes lingered at His\nside, marveling at His wisdom. His manner corresponded with the\ngreat truths He proclaimed. There was no apology, no hesitancy, not\nthe shadow of a doubt or uncertainty that it might be other than He\nGod’sWordTheMeansOfOurSanctification,March28 195\ndeclared. He spoke ofthe earthly andthe heavenly, ofthe human and\nthe divine, with positive authority; and the people “were astonished\nat his doctrine: for his word was with power.” ...\nIt is a matter of the highest importance and interest to us that\nwe understand what truth is, and our petitions should go forth with\nintense earnestness that we may be guided into all truth.\nDavid appreciated the divine enlightenment, and recognized the\npower of the Word of God. He declared, “The entrance of thy words\ngiveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.” Let those who\ndesire lightsearchthe Scriptures, comparing scripture withscripture,\nand pleading with God for the illumination of the Holy Spirit.

        "content": "When we speak of faith, there is a distinction that should be\nborne in mind. There is a kind of belief that is wholly distinct from\nfaith. The existence and power of God, the truth of His Word, are\nfacts that even Satan and his hosts cannot at heart deny. The Bible\nsays that “the devils also believe, and tremble” (James 2:19); but\nthis is not faith. Where there is not only a belief in God’s Word, but\na submission of the will to Him; where the heart is yielded to Him,\nthe affections fixed upon Him, there is faith—faith that works by\nlove and purifies the soul.\nThrough this faith the heart is renewed in the image of God. And\nthe heart that in its unrenewed state is not subject to the law of God,\nneither indeed can be, now delights in its holy precepts, exclaiming\nwith the psalmist, “O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the\nday” (Psalm 119:97). And the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in\nus, “who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit” (Romans 8:1).\nThere are those who have known the pardoning love of Christ\nandwhoreallydesiretobechildren ofGod, yettheyrealizethattheir\ncharacter is imperfect, their life faulty, and they are ready to doubt\nwhether their hearts have been renewed by the Holy Spirit. To such I\nwould say, Do not draw back in despair. We shall often have to bow\ndown and weep at the feet of Jesus because of our shortcomings and\nmistakes, but we are not to be discouraged. Even if we are overcome\nby the enemy, we are not cast off, not forsaken and rejected of God.\nNo; Christ is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession\nfor us. Said the beloved John, “These things write I unto you, that\nye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,\nJesus Christ the righteous” (1 John 2:1).\nAnd do not forget the words of Christ, “the Father himself loveth\nyou” (John 16:27). He desires to restore you to Himself, to see His\nFaiththatWorksbyLove,April19 241\nown purity and holiness reflected in you. And if you will but yield\nyourself to Him, He that hath begun a good work in you will carry\nit forward to the day of Jesus Christ. Pray more fervently; believe\nmore fully....\nThe less we see to esteem in ourselves, the more we shall see to\nesteem in the infinite purity and loveliness of our Saviour. A view of\nour sinfulness drives us to Him who can pardon; and when the soul,\nrealizing its helplessness, reaches out after Christ, He will reveal\nHimself in power. The more our sense of need drives us to Him and\nto the Word of God, the more exalted views we shall have of His\ncharacter, and the more fully we shall reflect His image.—Steps to\nChrist, 63-65."

When they came in for examination, the result was\ndecidedly in their favor.\nIt was otherwise with the youth who had eaten of the luxuries\nof the king’s table, and drank of his wine. The clear sparkle of the\neye was gone; the ruddy, healthful glow had disappeared from the\ncountenance. The four Hebrew captives were thereafter permitted to\nhave the diet they had chosen. What effect did it have upon mind\nand character? They had conscientiously refused the stimulus of\nflesh and of wine. They obeyed God’s will in self-denial, and He\nshowed His approval. He desired His servants to honor Him by\ntheir adherence to steadfast principle in all their habits of life. Their\ncountenances would be a certificate of physical soundness and moral\npurity.\n“And as for these four children, God gave them knowledge and\nskill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in\nall visions and dreams.” These youth had the Lord as their educator.\nThe golden links of the chain of heaven connected the finite with\nthe infinite.

It is not merely a theory, an emotion, or a form of words, but a\nliving, active principle, entering into the everyday life.

The words of wisdom “are\nlife unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh” (Proverbs\n4:22).\nTrue religion brings man into harmony with the laws of God,\nphysical, mental, and moral. It teaches self-control, serenity, tem-\nperance. Religion ennobles the mind, refines the taste, and sanctifies\nthe judgment. It makes the soul a partaker of the purity of heaven.\nFaith in God’s love and overruling providence lightens the burdens\nof anxiety and care. It fills the heart with joy and contentment in the\nhighest or the lowliest lot. Religion tends directly to promote health,\nto lengthen life, and to heighten our enjoyment of all its blessings. It\nopens to the soul a never-failing fountain of happiness. Would that\nTrueReligionPromotesHealth,May19 303\nall who have not chosen Christ might realize that He has something\nvastly better to offer them than they are seeking for themselves....\nThere is an intimate relation between the mind and the body, and\nin order to reach a high standard of moral and intellectual attainment\nthe laws that control our physical being must be heeded. To secure\na strong, well-balanced character, both the mental and the physical\npowers must be exercised and developed. What study can be more\nimportant ... than that which treats of this wonderful organism\nthat God has committed to us, and of the laws by which it may be\npreserved in health?—Patriarchs and Prophets, 600, 601."

Right habits must be formed.\nUnder the discipline of the greatest Teacher the world has ever\nknown, Christians must move onward and upward toward perfection.\nThis is God’s command, and no one should say, I cannot do it. He\nshould say instead, God requires me to be perfect, and He will give\nme strength to overcome all that stands in the way of perfection. He\nis the source of all wisdom, all power....\nChristians are to be light bearers, saying to all with whom they\ncome in contact, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the\nsin of the world.” They are to be examples of piety, representing\nChrist in word, in spirit, in action. Their actions are to be a copy\nof the actions of the Saviour. Thus they are to show the superiority\nof Christ’s principles over the principles of the world. They are\nto work upon a higher plane of action than do those who are not\nChristians. They are to bring the ennobling influence of the gospel\ninto every phase of life. Their purity and usefulness are to be a\nsource of illumination to others.\nThe world has set up a standard to suit the inclinations of unsanc-\ntified hearts, but this is not the standard of those who love Christ.\nThe Redeemer has chosen them out of the world, and has left them\nHis sinless life as a standard. He wants them to rise above all cheap-\nness of word or action.... “Gird up the loins of your mind, be sober,\nand hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at\nthe revelation of Jesus Christ; ...as he which hath called you is holy,\nso be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written, Be\nye holy; for I am holy.”\nThese words are to be believed and practiced.

We are to use no power of our being for selfish gratification;\nfor all our powers belong to Him, and are to be used to His glory....\nThe human house, God’s building, requires close, watchful\nguardianship.

God expects men to use the intellect He\nTempleofGod,May31 327\nhas given them. He expects them to use every reasoning power for\nHim.

That home,\nbeautified by the hand of God Himself, was not a gorgeous palace....\nGod placed Adam in a garden. This was his dwelling.... In the\nsurroundings of the holy pair was a lesson for all time—that true\nhappiness is found, not in the indulgence of pride and luxury, but in\ncommunion with God through His created works. If men would give\nless attention to the artificial, and would cultivate greater simplicity,\nthey would come far nearer to answering the purpose of God in their\ncreation. Pride and ambition are never satisfied, but those who are\ntruly wise will find substantial and elevating pleasure in the sources\nof enjoyment that God has placed within the reach of all.\nTo the dwellers in Eden was committed the care of the garden,\n“to dress it and to keep it.” Their occupation was not wearisome,\nbut pleasant and invigorating. God appointed labor as a blessing to\nman, to occupy his mind, to strengthen his body, and to develop his\nfaculties. In mental and physical activity Adam found one of the\nhighest pleasures of his holy existence.... The holy pair were not\nEden,theFirstHome,June1 331\nonly children under the fatherly care of God but students receiving\ninstruction from the all-wise Creator.... The order and harmony of\ncreation spoke to them of infinite wisdom and power. They were\never discovering some attraction that filled their hearts with deeper\nlove and called forth fresh expressions of gratitude.\nSo long as they remained loyal to the divine law, their capacity to\nknow, to enjoy, and to love would continually increase. They would\nbe constantly gaining new treasures of knowledge, discovering fresh\nsprings of happiness, and obtaining clearer and yet clearer concep-\ntions of the immeasurable, unfailing love of God.—Patriarchs and\nProphets, 46-51."

Any betrayal of the church is treachery to Him\nwho has bought mankind with the blood of His only-begotten Son.\nFrom the beginning, faithful souls have constituted the church on\nearth. In every age the Lord has had His watchmen, who have borne\na faithful testimony to the generation in which they lived. These\nsentinels gave the message of warning; and when they were called\nto lay off their armor, others took up the work. God brought these\nwitnesses into covenant relation with Himself, uniting the church\non earth with the church in heaven. He has sent forth His angels to\nGod’sChurchtoReflectHisGlory,July1 393\nminister to His church, and the gates of hell have not been able to\nprevail against His people.\nThrough centuries of persecution, conflict, and darkness, God\nhas sustained His church. Not one cloud has fallen upon it that He\nhasnotpreparedfor; notoneopposingforcehasrisentocounterwork\nHis work, that He has not foreseen. All has taken place as He\npredicted. He has not left His church forsaken, but has traced in\nprophetic declarations what would occur, and that which His Spirit\ninspired the prophets to foretell has been brought about. All His\npurposes will be fulfilled. His law is linked with His throne, and no\npower of evil can destroy it. Truth is inspired and guarded by God;\nand it will triumph over all opposition.—The Acts of the Apostles,\n9-12."

        "content": "The two classes of watchers represent the two classes who pro-\nfess to be waiting for their Lord. They are called virgins because\nthey profess a pure faith. By the lamps is represented the Word of\nGod. The psalmist says, “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a\nlight unto my path.” The oil is a symbol of the Holy Spirit. Thus the\nSpirit is represented in the prophecy of Zechariah.... “I have looked,\nand behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it,\nand his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, ...\nand two olive trees by it.” ...\nFrom the two olive trees the golden oil was emptied through the\ngolden pipes into the bowl of the candlestick, and thence into the\ngolden lamps that gave light to the sanctuary. So from the holy ones\nthat stand in God’s presence His Spirit is imparted to the human\ninstrumentalities who are consecrated to His service. The mission\nof the two anointed ones is to communicate to God’s people that\nheavenly grace which alone can make His Word a lamp to the feet\nand a light to the path. “Not by might, nor by power, but by my\nspirit, saith the Lord of hosts.”\nIntheparable,allthetenvirginswentouttomeetthebridegroom.\nAll had lamps and vessels for oil. For a time there was seen no\ndifference between them. So with the church that lives just before\nChrist’s second coming. All have a knowledge of the Scriptures. All\nhave heard the message of Christ’s near approach, and confidently\nexpect His appearing. But as in the parable, so it is now. A time of\nwaiting intervenes, faith is tried; and when the cry is heard, “Behold,\nthe bridegroom cometh,” ... many are unready. They have no oil in\ntheir vessels with their lamps. They are destitute of the Holy Spirit....\nThe theory of truth, unaccompanied by the Holy Spirit, cannot\nquicken the soul or sanctify the heart. One may be familiar with the\nTwoClassesofWatchers,July15 421\ncommands and promises of the Bible; but unless the Spirit of God\nsets the truth home, the character will not be transformed. Without\nthe enlightenment of the Spirit, men will not be able to distinguish\ntruth from error, and they will fall under the masterful temptations\nof Satan....\nCharacterisnottransferable.

        "content": "Christ with His disciples is seated upon the Mount of Olives.\nThe sun has set behind the mountains, and the heavens are curtained\nwith the shades of evening. In full view is a dwelling house lighted\nup brilliantly as if for some festive scene. The light streams from the\nopenings, and an expectant company wait around, indicating that a\nmarriage procession is soon to appear.\nIn many parts of the East, wedding festivities are held in the\nevening. The bridegroom goes forth to meet his bride and bring her\nto his home. By torchlight the bridal party proceed from her father’s\nhouse to his own, where a feast is provided for the invited guests.\nIn the scene upon which Christ looks, a company are waiting the\nappearance of the bridal party, intending to join the procession.\nLingering near the bride’s house are ten young women robed in\nwhite. Each carries a lighted lamp and a small flagon for oil. All are\nanxiously watching for the appearance of the bridegroom. But there\nis a delay. Hour after hour passes; the watchers become weary and\nfall asleep. At midnight the cry is heard, “Behold, the bridegroom\ncometh; go ye out to meet him.” The sleepers, suddenly awaking,\nspring to their feet. They see the procession moving on, bright with\ntorches and glad with music. They hear the voice of the bridegroom\nand the voice of the bride.\nThe ten maidens seize their lamps and begin to trim them, in\nhaste to go forth. But five have neglected to fill their flasks with oil.\nThey did not anticipate so long a delay, and they have not prepared\nfor the emergency. In distress they appeal to their wiser companions,\nsaying, “Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out.” But the\nwaiting five, with their freshly trimmed lamps, have emptied their\nflagons.

        "content": "The wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. Matthew\n25:4.\nIn the parable the wise virgins had oil in their vessels with their\nlamps. Their light burned with undimmed flame through the night\nof watching. It helped to swell the illumination for the bridegroom’s\nhonor. Shining out in the darkness, it helped to illuminate the way\nto the home of the bridegroom, to the marriage feast.\nSo the followers of Christ are to shed light into the darkness\nof the world. Through the Holy Spirit, God’s Word is a light as\nit becomes a transforming power in the life of the receiver. By\nimplanting in their hearts the principles of His Word, the Holy Spirit\ndevelops in men the attributes of God. The light of His glory—His\ncharacter—is to shine forth in His followers. Thus they are to glorify\nGod, to lighten the path to the Bridegroom’s home, to the city of\nGod, to the marriage supper of the Lamb.\nThe coming of the bridegroom was at midnight—the darkest\nhour. So the coming of Christ will take place in the darkest period of\nthis earth’s history. The days of Noah and Lot picture the condition\nof the world just before the coming of the Son of man. The Scrip-\ntures pointing forward to this time declare that Satan will work with\nall power and “with all deceivableness of unrighteousness” (2 Thes-\nsalonians 2:9, 10). His working is plainly revealed by the rapidly\nincreasing darkness, the multitudinous errors, heresies, and delu-\nsions of these last days. Not only is Satan leading the world captive,\nbut his deceptions are leavening the professed churches of our Lord\nJesus Christ. The great apostasy will develop into darkness deep as\nmidnight, impenetrable as sackcloth of hair. To God’s people it will\nbe a night of trial, a night of weeping, a night of persecution for the\ntruth’s sake. But out of that night of darkness God’s light will shine.\nHe causes “the light to shine out of darkness” (2 Corinthians\n4:6). When “the earth was without form, and void; and darkness\nWiseVirginsLetTheirLightShine,July16 423\nwas upon the face of the deep,” “the Spirit of God moved upon the\nface of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was\nlight” (Genesis 1:2, 3). So in the night of spiritual darkness, God’s\nWord goes forth, “Let there be light.” To His people He says, “Arise,\nshine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon\nthee” (Isaiah 60:1).\n“Behold,” says the Scripture, “the darkness shall cover the earth,\nand gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee,\nand his glory shall be seen upon thee” (verse 2).—Christ’s Object\nLessons, 414, 415."

We need\npower from above, that we may understand, as far as the human\nmind can, the great themes of Christianity and their far-reaching\nprinciples.\nThose who are under the influence of the Spirit of God will\nnot be fanatical, but calm and steadfast, free from extravagance in\nthought, word, or deed. Amid the confusion of delusive doctrines,\nthe Spirit of God will be a guide and a shield to those who have not\nresisted the evidences of truth, silencing every other voice but that\nwhich comes from Him who is the truth.\nWe are living in the last days, when error of a most deceptive\ncharacter is accepted and believed, while truth is discarded. The\nLord will hold both ministers and people responsible for the light\nshining upon them. He calls upon us to work diligently in gathering\nup the jewels of truth, and placing them in the framework of the\nHolySpirit’sPowerNeededinEnd-Time,July21 433\ngospel. In all their divine beauty they are to shine forth in the moral\ndarkness of the world. This cannot be accomplished without the aid\nof the Holy Spirit, but with this aid we can do all things. When we\nare endowed with the Spirit, we take hold by faith of infinite power.\nThereisnothinglostofthatwhichcomesfrom God.

Our part is not to exhibit self,\nbut to let the Holy Spirit work in us. Thus, self-deceived men and\nwomen may be rescued from delusion.\nAll, high or low, if they are unconverted, are on one common\nplatform. Men may turn from one doctrine to another. This is being\ndone, andwillbe done.... Yetthey may know nothing ofthe meaning\nof the words, “A new heart also will I give you.” Accepting new\ntheories, and uniting with a church, do not bring new life to anyone,\neven though the church with which he unites may be established\non the true foundation. Connection with a church does not take the\nplace of conversion. To subscribe the name to a church creed is not\nof the least value to anyone if the heart is not truly changed.\nThis question is a serious one, and its meaning should be fully\nrealized. Men may be church members, and may apparently work\nearnestly, performing a round of duties from year to year, and yet be\nunconverted.... But when the truth is received as truth by the heart, it\nhas passed through the conscience, and has captivated the soul with\nits pure principles. It is placed in the heart by the Holy Spirit, who\nreveals its beauty to the mind, that its transforming power may be\nseen in the character....\nWith the great truth we have been privileged to receive, we\nshould, and under the Holy Spirit’s power we could, become living\nchannelsoflight. Wecouldthen approachthemercyseat; andseeing\nthe bow of promise, kneel with contrite hearts, and seek the kingdom\nof heaven with a spiritual violence that would bring its own reward.\nWe would take it by force, as did Jacob.

The truth would be expressed by life and character, and\nby lips touched with the living coal from off God’s altar.\nWhen this experience is ours, we shall be lifted out of our poor,\ncheap selves that we have cherished so tenderly. We shall empty our\nhearts of the corroding power of selfishness, and shall be filled with\npraise and gratitude to God. We shall magnify the Lord, the God of\nall grace, who has magnified Christ.

For He\nreceived from God the Father honour and glory, when there came\nsuch a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved\nSon, in whom I am well pleased. And this voice which came from\nheaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.”\nYet convincing as was this evidence of the certainty of the be-\nlievers’ hope, there was another still more convincing in the witness\nof prophecy, through which the faith of all must be confirmed and\nsecurely anchored. “We have also,” Peter declared, “a more sure\nword of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto\na light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day\nstar arise in your hearts: knowing this first, that no prophecy of the\nscripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not\nin old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they\nwere moved by the Holy Ghost.”\nWhile exalting the “sure word of prophecy” as a safe guide in\ntimes of peril, the apostle solemnly warned the church against the\ntorch of false prophecy, which would be uplifted by “false teachers,”\nwho would privily bring in “damnable heresies, even denying the\nLord” (2 Peter 2:1). These false teachers, arising in the church and\naccounted true by many of their brethren in the faith, the apostle\ncompared to “wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tem-\npest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.” “The latter\nWehavea“MoreSureWordofProphecy”,July26 443\nend is worse with them,” he declared, “than the beginning.

They did not realize that happiness\nand joy were going out of their lives and that, having shut the love\nof God out of their hearts, they would soon walk in darkness.\nJohn, realizing that brotherly love was waning in the church,\nurged upon believers the constant need of this love.

A\nremnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.\nIsaiah 10:20, 21, R.S.V.\nIn vision I saw two armies in terrible conflict. One army was\nled by banners bearing the world’s insignia; the other was led by the\nbloodstained banner of Prince Immanuel. Standard after standard\nwas left to trail in the dust as company after company from the\nLord’s army joined the foe and tribe after tribe from the ranks of the\nenemy united with the commandment-keeping people of God. An\nangel flying in the midst of heaven put the standard of Immanuel\ninto many hands, while a mighty general cried out with a loud voice:\n“Come into line. Let those who are loyal to the commandments of\nGod and the testimony of Christ now take their position. Come out\nfrom among them, and be ye separate.” ...\nThe battle raged. Victory alternated from side to side. Now the\nsoldiers of the cross gave way, “as when a standardbearer fainteth”\n(Isaiah 10:18). But their apparent retreat was but to gain a more\nadvantageous position. Shouts of joy were heard. A song of praise\nto God went up, and angel voices united in the song, as Christ’s\nsoldiers plantedHis banneron the walls offortresses tillthen heldby\nthe enemy. The Captain of our salvation was ordering the battle and\nsending support to His soldiers. His power was mightily displayed,\nencouraging them to press the battle to the gates. He taught them\nterrible things in righteousness as He led them on step by step,\nconquering and to conquer.\nAt last the victory was gained. The army following the banner\nwith the inscription, “The commandments of God, and the faith\nof Jesus,” was gloriously triumphant.—Testimonies for the Church\n8:41.\nChurchDoesNotFall,July31 453\nThere are many doctrines current in our world. There is many a\nreligion current that numbers its thousands and tens of thousands,\nbut there is but one that bears the superscription and the stamp of\nGod. There is a religion of man and a religion of God. We must\nhave our souls riveted to the eternal Rock....\nSatan will work his miracles to deceive; he will set up his power\nas supreme. The church may appear as about to fall, but it does not\nfall. It remains, while the sinners in Zion will be sifted out—the\nchaff separated from the precious wheat. This is a terrible ordeal,\nbut nevertheless it must take place. None but those who have been\novercomingbythebloodoftheLambandthewordoftheirtestimony\nwill be found with the loyal and true, without spot or stain of sin,\nwithout guile in their mouths. We must be divested of our self-\nrighteousness and arrayed in the righteousness of Christ.—Selected\nMessages 2:379, 380.\n454 ReflectingChrist\nAugust"

Organized effort should be made to save them. We are now\nto work to convert ... those who are living within the shadow of our\ndoors. A new song is to be put in their mouths, and they are to go\nforth to impart to others now in darkness the light of the third angel’s\nmessage.\nWe all need to be wide awake, that, as the way opens, we may\nadvance the work in the large cities.

Many\nare longing for spiritual food. We are to continue working until\na church is organized and a humble house of worship built. I am\ngreatly encouraged to believe that many persons not of our faith will\nhelp considerably by their means. The light given me is that in many\nplaces, especially in the great cities ..., help will be given by such\npersons....\nThose who undertake to work for God in our cities must go\nforward in faith, doing their very best.

They will obtain an\nexperience that will be invaluable to them in their afterwork. “Faith\nis the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”\nThousandstobeWarnedintheCities,August15 485\nMy mind is deeply stirred.

Of their experience at that\ntime we read: “And when they had prayed, the place was shaken\nwhere they were assembled together; and they were all filled with\nthe Holy Ghost, and they spake the Word of God with boldness.\nAnd the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of\none soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he\npossessed was his own.” Selfishness was expelled from the heart.\n“And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection\nof the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.”—Pacific"

Who can doubt that satanic agencies are\nat work among men with increasing activity to distract and corrupt\nthe mind, and defile and destroy the body?\nAnd while the world is filled with these evils, the gospel is\ntoo often presented in so indifferent a manner as to make but little\nimpression upon the consciences or the lives of men. Everywhere\nthere are hearts crying out for something which they have not. They\nlong for a power that will give them mastery over sin, a power that\nwill deliver them from the bondage of evil, a power that will give\nhealth and life and peace. Many who once knew the power of God’s\nWord have dwelt where there is no recognition of God, and they\nlong for the divine presence.\nThe world needs today what it needed nineteen hundred years\nago—a revelation of Christ.

It was the unfaithful servant who said, “My\nLord delayeth his coming,” and began to smite his fellow servants,\nand eat and drink with the drunken.\nThe exact time of Christ’s second coming is not revealed.

ThereisacontinualwaitinguponGodandasubmissionof\nthe will to His. The understanding grasps every divine truth, and the\nwill bows to every divine precept, without doubting or murmuring.\nTrue meekness softens and subdues the heart and gives the mind a\nfitness for the engrafted Word. It brings the thoughts into obedience\nto Jesus Christ. It opens the heart to the Word of God, as Lydia’s\nwas opened. It places us with Mary, as learners at the feet of Jesus.\n“The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach\nhis way” (Psalm 25:9).\nThe language of the meek is never that of boasting. Like the\nchild Samuel, they pray, “Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth” (1\nSamuel 3:9)....\nMeekness in the school of Christ is one of the marked fruits of\nthe Spirit. It is a grace wrought by the Holy Spirit as a sanctifier,\nand enables its possessor at all times to control a rash and impetuous\ntemper. When the grace of meekness is cherished by those who are\nnaturally sour or hasty in disposition, they will put forth the most\nearnest efforts to subdue their unhappy temper. Every day they will\ngain self-control, until that which is unlovely and unlike Jesus is\nconquered. They become assimilated to the Divine Pattern, until\nthey can obey the inspired injunction, “Be swift to hear, slow to\nspeak, slow to wrath” (James 1:19)....\nMeekness is the inward adorning, which God estimates as of\ngreatprice. The apostle speaks ofthis as more excellentandvaluable\nthan gold or pearls or costly array. While the outward adorning\nbeautifies only the mortal body, the ornament of meekness adorns\nthe soul and connects finite man with the infinite God. This is the\nMeekness,anAdorningoftheSoul,September7 533\nornament of God’s own choice. He who garnished the heavens\nwith the orbs of light has by the same Spirit promised that “he will\nbeautify the meek with salvation.” Angels of heaven will register as\nbest adorned those who put on the Lord Jesus and walk with Him in\nmeekness and lowliness of mind.\nThere are high attainments for the Christian. He may ever be\nrising to higher attainments.—The Sanctified Life, 14-16."

We\nspoke of the express declaration of Scripture against the wearing\nof gold. But she referred to where Solomon was commanded to\nbeautify the Temple, and to the statement that the streets of the\nCity of God were pure gold. She said that if we could improve our\nappearance by wearing gold, so as to have influence in the world, it\nwas right.\nI replied that we were poorfallen mortals, and instead of decorat-\ning these bodies because Solomon’s Temple was gloriously adorned,\nwe should remember our fallen condition, and that it cost the suffer-\ning and death of the Son of God to redeem us. This thought should\ncause us self-abasement.\nJesus is our pattern. If He would lay aside His humiliation and\nsufferings, and cry, “If any man will come after Me, let him please\nhimself, and enjoy the world, and he shall be My disciple,” the\nmultitude would believe and follow Him. But Jesus will come to\nus in no other character than that of the meek, crucified One. If we\nwould be with Him in heaven, we must be like Him on earth.

Proverbs 11:24, 25.\nMany have pitied the lot of the Israel of God in being compelled\nto give systematically, besides making liberal offerings yearly. An\nall-wise God knew best what system of benevolence would be in\naccordance with His providence, and has given His people directions\nin regard to it. It has ever proved that nine tenths are worth more\nto them than ten tenths. Those who have thought to increase their\ngains by withholding from God, or by bringing Him an inferior\noffering—the lame, the blind, or the diseased—have been sure to\nsuffer loss.\nProvidence, though unseen, is ever at work in the affairs of men.\nGod’s hand can prosper or withhold, and He frequently withholds\nfrom one while He seems to prosper another. All this is to test\nand prove man to reveal the heart. He lets misfortune overtake one\nbrother while He prospers others to see if those whom He favors\nhave His fear before their eyes and will perform the duty enjoined\nupon them in His Word to love their neighbor as themselves and to\nhelp their poorer brother from a love to do good. Acts of generosity\nand benevolence were designed by God to keep the hearts of the\nchildren of men tender and sympathetic and to encourage in them\nan interest and affection for one another in imitation of the Master,\nwho for our sakes became poor, that we through His poverty might\nbe made rich. The law of tithing was founded upon an enduring\nprinciple and was designed to be a blessing to man.\nThe system of benevolence was arranged to prevent the great\nevil, covetousness.—Testimonies for the Church 3:546, 547.\nThe small streams of beneficence must be ever kept flowing into\nthe treasury.

Men who have qualifications for\nthe work need to have their talents exercised and perfected by most\nthorough study and training. Not one businessman that has any\nappointment in the work need to be a novice. If men in any line of\nwork need to improve their opportunities to become wise, efficient\nbusinessmen, it is those who are using their ability in the work of\nbuilding up the kingdom of God in our world.\nThe lessons forthe presenttime are forallto understand, butthey\nare very feebly appreciated.

The human agent is to reach for\nperfection, to be an ideal Christian, complete in Jesus Christ.\nThose who labor in business lines should exercise every pre-\ncaution against error through wrong principles or methods. Their\nrecord may be like that of Daniel in the courts of Babylon. In all his\nbusiness transactions, when subjected to the closest scrutiny, there\nwas not found one item that was faulty.

These are notthe principles thatgovern the world; for\nthere Satan is master, and his principles of deception and oppression\nbear sway. But Christians serve under a different Master, and their\nactions must be wrought in God. They must put aside all desire for\nselfish gain.\nTo some, deviation from perfect fairness in business deals may\nlook like a small thing, but our Saviour does not thus regard it. His\nwords on this point are plain and explicit: “He that is faithful in that\nwhich is least is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in the\nleast is unjust also in much.” A man who will overreach in a small\nmatter will overreach in a larger matter if the temptation comes to\nhim.\nChrist’s followers are obliged to be more or less connected with\nthe world in business matters. In His prayer for them the Saviour\nsays, “I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but\nthat thou shouldest keep them from the evil.” Christians are to buy\nand sell with the realization that the eye of God is upon them. Never\nare they to use false balances or deceitful weights....\nIn every action of life the true Christian is just what he desires\nthose around him to think he is. He is guided by truth and upright-\nness. He does not scheme; therefore he has nothing to gloss over. He\nmay be criticized, he may be tested; but through all, his unbending\nintegrity shines out like pure gold. He is a friend and benefactor to\nall connected with him; and his fellow men place confidence in him;\nfor he is trustworthy."

Instead of releasing man from\nobedience, it is faith, and faith only, that makes us partakers of the\ngrace of Christ, which enables us to render obedience.\nWe do not earn salvation by our obedience, for salvation is the\nfree gift of God, to be received by faith. But obedience is the fruit of\nfaith. “Ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and\nin him is no sin. Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not” (chap. 3:5,\n6). Here is the true test. If we abide in Christ, if the love of God\ndwells in us, our feelings, our thoughts, our purposes, our actions,\nwill be in harmony with the will of God as expressed in the precepts\nof His holy law. “Little children, let no man deceive you; he that\ndoeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous” (verse\n7). Righteousness is defined by the standard of God’s holy law, as\nexpressed in the ten precepts given on Sinai.\nThe so-called faith in Christ which professes to release men from\nthe obligation of obedience to God is not faith, but presumption. “By\ngrace are ye saved through faith” (Ephesians 2:8). But “faith, if it\nhath not works, is dead” (James 2:17). Jesus said of Himself before\nHe came to earth, “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law\nis within my heart” (Psalm 40:8). Andjustbefore He ascendedagain\nto heaven, He declared, “I have kept my Father’s commandments,\nand abide in his love” (John 15:10). The Scriptures says, “Hereby\nwe do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments” (1\nJohn 2:3)....\nObedience,theFruitofFaith,September17 553\nTheconditionofeternallifeisnowjustwhatitalwayshasbeen—\njust what it was in Paradise before the fall of our first parents—\nperfect obedience to the law of God, perfect righteousness. If eternal\nlife were granted on any condition short of this, then the happiness\nof the whole universe would be imperiled. The way would be open\nfor sin, with all its train of woe and misery, to be immortalized....\nThe more our sense of need drives us to Him and to the Word of\nGod, the more exalted views we shall have of His character, and the\nmore fully we shall reflect His image.—Steps to Christ, 60-65."

We shall have to\ncriticize ourselves closely, and allow not one unfavorable trait to\nremain uncorrected....\nA character formed according to the divine likeness is the only\ntreasure that we can take from this world to the next. Those who are\nunder the instruction of Christ in this world will take every divine\nattainment with them to the heavenly mansions....\nThe heavenly intelligences will work with the human agent who\nseeks with determined faith that perfection of character which will\nreach out to perfection in action. To everyone engaged in this work\nChrist says, I am at your right hand to help you.\nAs the will of man cooperates with the will of God, it becomes\nomnipotent. Whatever is to be done at His command may be accom-\nplished in His strength. All His biddings are enablings.—Christ’s\nObject Lessons, 331-333.\nCharacter is power. The silent witness of a true, unselfish, godly\nlife carries an almost irresistible influence. By revealing in our own\nlife the character of Christ we cooperate with Him in the work of\nsaving souls. It is only by revealing in our life His character that we\ncan cooperate with Him. And the wider the sphere of our influence,\nthe more good we may do. When those who profess to serve God\nfollow Christ’s example, practicing the principles of the law in their\nCharacterisPower,October11 603\ndailylife; wheneveryactbearswitnessthattheyloveGodsupremely\nand their neighbor as themselves, then will the church have power\nto move the world....\nWe know not what results a day, an hour, or a moment may\ndetermine, and never should we begin the day without committing\nour ways to our heavenly Father.... When unconsciously we are\nin danger of exerting a wrong influence, the angels will be by our\nside, prompting us to a better course, choosing our words for us,\nand influencing our actions. Thus our influence may be a silent,\nunconscious, but mighty power in drawing others to Christ and the\nheavenly world.—Christ’s Object Lessons, 340-342."

When Christ shall come, our\nvile bodies are to be changed, and made like His glorious body; but\nthe vile character will not be made holy then. The transformation of\ncharacter must take place before His coming. Our natures must be\npure and holy; we must have the mind of Christ, that He may behold\nwith pleasure His image reflected upon our souls.\nEnoch was a marked character, and many look upon his life as\nsomething far above what the generality of mortals can ever reach.\nBut Enoch’s life and character, which were so holy that he was\ntranslated to heaven without seeing death, represent the lives and\ncharacters of all who will be translated when Christ comes. His\nlife was what the life of every individual may be if he will live\nnear to God. We should remember that Enoch was surrounded by\nunholy influences.

Through divine\ngrace they cultivated only such qualities as were favorable to the\ndevelopment of pure and holy characters.\nThus it may be with us. The spirit which Enoch, Joseph and\nDaniel possessed, we may have; we may draw from the same source\nof strength, possess the same power of self-control, and the same\ngraces may shine out in our lives.—The Signs of the Times, Novem-\nber 11, 1886."

Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness,\nbrotherly kindness, and charity are the rounds of the ladder.

Satan, when tempting Eve to disobey\nGod, said to her, “Ye shall not surely die.” Great men, worldly,\nhonored, and wise men, repeated the same story, “Ye shall not surely\ndie.” “The threatenings of God,” they said, “are for the purpose of\nintimidating, and will never be verified. You need not be alarmed.\nSuch an event as the destruction of the world by the God who made\nit, and the punishment of the beings He has created, will never take\nplace.” ... So the people did not humble their hearts before God, but\ncontinued their disobedience and wickedness, the same as though\nGod had not spoken to them through His servant.\nBut Noah stood like a rock amid the tempest. He was surrounded\nby every species of wickedness and moral corruption; but amid pop-\nular contempt and ridicule, amid universal wickedness and disobedi-\nence, he distinguished himself by His holy integrity and unwavering\nfaithfulness. While the world around him were disregarding God,\nand were indulging in all manner of extravagant dissipation which\nled to violence and crimes of every kind, the faithful preacher of\nrighteousness declared to that generation that a flood of water was\nto deluge the world because of the unsurpassed wickedness of its\ninhabitants. He warned them to repent and believe, and find refuge\nin the ark.\nThe message of Noah was to him a reality. Amid the scoffs\nand jeers of the world, he was an unbending witness for God. His\nmeekness and righteousness were in bright contrast to the revolting\ncrimes, intrigue, and violence continually practiced around him.\nA power attended his words; for it was the voice of God to man\nthrough His servant.

When his voice was lifted in\nwarning of what God was about to bring upon the world in judgment\nbecause of the wickedness of men, great opposition was manifested\nagainst the words of the messenger. The opposition, however, was\nnot entirely worldwide; for some believed the message of Noah, and\nzealously repeated the warning.\nBut the men who were accounted wise were sought, and were\nurged to present arguments by which the message of Noah might\nbe counteracted. And as the world was at peace and not at war with\nthe prince of evil, they were glad of any excuse to set aside the\n“Thus saith the Lord” and to listen to the philosophers of the age,\nwho presented the impossibility of such a change taking place in\nthe forces of nature as Noah predicted. There is no enmity between\nfallen man and fallen angels; both are evil through apostasy, and\nevil, wherever it exists, is in league against God. Fallen men and\nfallen angels were united for the dethronement of God.\nThus it was that the wise men of this world talked of science\nand the fixed laws of nature, and declared that there could be no\nvariation in these laws, and that this message of Noah could not\npossibly be true. The talented men of Noah’s time set themselves\nin league against God’s will and purpose and scorned the message\nand the messenger that He had sent.... Noah could not controvert\ntheir philosophies, or refute the claims of science so called; but he\ncould proclaim the word of God; for he knew it contained the infinite\nwisdom of the Creator, and, as he sounded it everywhere, it lost none\nNoahProclaimedGod’sWordwithForce,November5 655\nof its force and reality because men of the world treated him with\nridicule and contempt.\nNoah did not mix the soft, pleasing deceptions of Satan with\nhis message.

        "content": "The Lord saw fit to test the faith of Abraham by a most fearful\ntrial. If he had endured the first test and had patiently waited for the\npromise to be fulfilled in Sarah, and had not taken Hagar as his wife,\nhe would not have been subjected to the closest test that was ever\nrequired of man. The Lord bade Abraham, “Take now thy son, ...\nwhom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer\nhim there for a burnt offering.” ...\nAbraham did not disbelieve God and hesitate, but early in the\nmorning he took two of his servants and Isaac, his son, and the wood\nfor the burnt offering, and went unto the place of which God had told\nhim.... Abraham did not suffer paternal feelings to control him and\nlead him to rebel against God. The command of God was calculated\nto stir the depths of his soul. “Take now thy son.” Then, as though\nto probe the heart a little deeper, He added, “Thine only son Isaac,\nwhom thou lovest”; that is, the only son of promise, “and offer him.”\n...\nThree days this father traveled with his son, having sufficient\ntime to reason and doubt God if he was disposed to doubt. But he\ndid not distrust God....\nAbraham believed that Isaac was the son of promise. He also\nbelieved that God meant just what He said when He bade him to\ngo offer him as a burnt offering. He ... believed that God who had\nin His providence given Sarah a son in her old age, and who had\nrequired him to take that son’s life, could also ... bring up Isaac from\nthe dead.\nAbraham left the servants by the way and proposed to go alone\nwith his son to worship some distance from them.... Firmly walked\non that stern, loving, suffering father by the side of his son. As they\ncame to the place which God had pointed out to Abraham, he built\nAbraham’sUnfalteringFaith,November7 659\nthere an altar and laid the wood in order, ready for the sacrifice, and\nthen informed Isaac of the command of God to offer him as a burnt\noffering. He repeated to him the promise that God several times had\nmade to him, that through Isaac he should become a great nation,\nand that in performing the command of God in slaying him, God\nwould fulfill His promise....\nIsaac believed in God.... After affectionately embracing his\nfather, he submitted to be bound and laid upon the wood. And as\nhis father’s hand was raised to slay his son, an angel of God, who\nhad marked all the faithfulness of Abraham ..., called to him out of\nheaven, and said, “Abraham .... Lay not thine hand upon the lad ...:\nfor now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld\nthy son, thine only son from me.”—The Story of Redemption, 80-82."

Genesis 50:19, 20.\nJoseph with his captors was on the way to Egypt.... The boy\ncould discern in the distance the hills among which lay his father’s\ntents. Bitterly he wept at the thought of that loving father in his\nloneliness and affliction. Again the scene at Dothan came up before\nhim. He saw his angry brothers and felt their fierce glances bent\nupon him. The stinging, insulting words that had met his agonized\nentreaties were ringing in his ears. With a trembling heart he looked\nforward to the future. What a change in situation—from the ten-\nderly cherished son to the despised and helpless slave! Alone and\nfriendless, what would be his lot in the strange land to which he was\ngoing? For a time, Joseph gave himself up to uncontrolled grief and\nterror.\nBut, in the providence of God, even this experience was to be\na blessing to him. He had learned in a few hours that which years\nmight not otherwise have taught him. His father, strong and tender\nas his love had been, had done him wrong by his partiality and\nindulgence. This unwise preference had angered his brothers and\nprovoked them to the cruel deed that had separated him from his\nhome. Its effects were manifest also in his own character. Faults\nhad been encouraged that were now to be corrected. He was be-\ncoming self-sufficient and exacting. Accustomed to the tenderness\nof his father’s care, he felt that he was unprepared to cope with the\ndifficulties before him....\nThen his thoughts turned to his father’s God. In his childhood he\nhad been taught to love and fear Him. Often in his father’s tent he\nhad listened to the story of the vision that Jacob saw as he fled from\nhis home an exile and a fugitive. He had been told of the Lord’s\npromises to Jacob, and how they had been fulfilled—how, in the\nJosephResolvestobeTruetoGod,November8 661\nhour of need, the angels of God had come to instruct, comfort, and\nprotect him. And he had learned of the love of God in providing\nfor men a Redeemer. Now all these precious lessons came vividly\nbefore him. Joseph believed that the God of his fathers would be\nhis God. He then and there gave himself fully to the Lord, and he\nprayed that the Keeper of Israel would be with him in the land of his\nexile.\nHis soul thrilled with the high resolve to prove himself true to\nGod—under all circumstances to act as became a subject of the\nKing of heaven. He would serve the Lord with undivided heart....\nOne day’s experience had been the turning point in Joseph’s life.\nIts terrible calamity had transformed him from a petted child to a\nman, thoughtful, courageous, and self-possessed.—Patriarchs and\nProphets, 213, 214."

        "content": "A few miles south of Jerusalem, “the city of the great King,” is\nBethlehem, where David, the son of Jesse, was born more than a\nthousand years before the infant Jesus was cradled in the manger\nand worshiped by the Wise Men from the East. Centuries before the\nadventoftheSaviour,David,inthefreshnessofboyhood,keptwatch\nof his flocks as they grazed on the hills surrounding Bethlehem. The\nsimple shepherd boy sang the songs of his own composing, and the\nmusic of his harp made a sweet accompaniment to the melody of his\nfresh young voice. The Lord had chosen David, and was preparing\nhim, in his solitary life with his flocks, for the work He designed to\ncommit to his trust in afteryears.—Patriarchs and Prophets, 637.\nDavid in his youth was intimately associated with Saul, and his\nstay at court and his connection with the king’s household gave him\nan insight into the cares and sorrows and perplexities concealed\nby the glitter and pomp of royalty. He saw of how little worth is\nhuman glory to bring peace to the soul. And it was with relief and\ngladness that he returned from the king’s court to the sheepfolds and\nthe flocks.\nWhen by the jealousy of Saul driven a fugitive into the wilder-\nness, David, cut off from human support, leaned more heavily upon\nGod. The uncertainty and unrest of the wilderness life, its unceasing\nperil, its necessity for frequent flight, the character of the men who\ngathered to him there—“every one that was in distress, and every\none that was in debt, and everyone that was discontented” (1 Samuel\n22:2)—all rendered the more essential a stern self-discipline.\nThese experiences aroused and developed power to deal with\nmen, sympathy for the oppressed, and hatred of injustice. Through\nyears of waiting and peril, David learned to find in God his comfort,\nhis support, his life. He learned that only by God’s power could\nDavidLearnsThroughHardship,November16 677\nhe come to the throne; only in His wisdom could he rule wisely. It\nwas through the training in the school of hardship and sorrow that\nDavid was able to make the record—though afterward marred with\nhis great sin—that he “executed judgment and justice unto all his\npeople.”—Education, 152.\nThe love that moved him, the sorrows that beset him, the tri-\numphs that attended him, were all themes for his active thought; and\nas he beheld the love of God in all the providences of his life, his\nheart throbbed with more fervent adoration and gratitude, his voice\nrang out in a richer melody, his harp was swept with more exul-\ntant joy; and the shepherd boy proceeded from strength to strength,\nfrom knowledge to knowledge; for the Spirit of the Lord was upon\nhim.—Patriarchs and Prophets, 642."

Of this experience he says:\n“I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me\nvineyards: I made me gardens and orchards ...: I got me servants\nand maidens ...: I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar\ntreasures of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and\nwomen singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical\ninstruments, and that of all sorts.

And\nthus, although the seed of his sowing was repeated by his people in\nharvests of evil, the lifework of Solomon was not wholly lost.

In a time of almost universal apostasy his\nfather’s household were among the number who had not bowed the\nknee to Baal. Theirs was a home where God was honored and where\nfaithfulness to duty was the rule of daily life.\nThe son of a wealthy farmer, Elisha had taken up the work that\nlay nearest. While possessing the capabilities of a leader among\nmen, he received a training in life’s common duties. In order to\ndirect wisely, he must learn to obey. By faithfulness in little things,\nhe was prepared for weightier trusts. Of a meek and gentle spirit,\nElisha possessed also energy and steadfastness. He cherished the\nlove and fear of God, and in the humble round of daily toil he gained\nstrength of purpose and nobleness of character, growing in divine\ngrace and knowledge. While cooperating with his father in the home\nduties, he was learning to cooperate with God.\nThe prophetic call came to Elisha while with his father’s servants\nhe was plowing in the field. As Elijah, divinely directed in seeking a\nsuccessor, cast his mantle upon the young man’s shoulders, Elisha\nrecognized and obeyed the summons. He “went after Elijah, and\nministered unto him” (1 Kings 19:21). It was no great work that was\nat first required of Elisha; commonplace duties still constituted his\ndiscipline. He is spoken of as pouring water on the hands of Elijah,\nhis master. As the prophet’s personal attendant, he continued to\nprove faithful in little things, while with daily strengthening purpose\nhe devoted himself to the mission appointed him by God....\nAs he turned to follow Elijah he was bidden by the prophet to\nreturn home. He must count the cost—decide for himself to accept\nElishaDemonstratesSteadfastness,November18 681\nor reject the call. But Elisha understood the value of his opportunity.\nNot for any worldly advantage would he forgo the possibility of\nbecoming God’s messenger, or sacrifice the privilege of association\nwith His servant.\nAstimepassed, andElijahpreparedfortranslation, soElishawas\nprepared to become his successor. And again his faith and resolution\nwere tested. Accompanying Elijah in his round of service, ... he\nwas at each place invited by the prophet to turn back....

We read that God opened the ears\nof Lydia, so that she attended to the message spoken by Paul. To\ndeclare the whole counsel of God and all that was essential for Lydia\nto receive—this was the part Paul was to act in her conversion; and\nthen the God of all grace exercised His power, leading the soul in\nthe right way.

The Philippians saw represented in the deportment and\npresence of mind of the apostles the spirit of the religion of Jesus\nChrist....\nThe news of their unjust imprisonment and miraculous deliv-\nerance was noised about through all that region, and brought the\napostles and their ministry before the notice of a large number who\nwould not otherwise have been reached.

He had warned the disciples that the\nchurch would be in more danger from this evil than from the perse-\ncution of her enemies. Again and again Paul warned the believers\nagainst these false teachers. This peril, above all others, they must\nguard against; for by receiving false teachers, they would open the\ndoor to errors by which the enemy would dim the spiritual percep-\ntions and shake the confidence of those newly come to the faith of\nthe gospel.\nChrist was the standard by which they were to test the doctrines\npresented. All that was not in harmony with His teachings they were\nto reject. Christ crucified for sin, Christ risen from the dead, Christ\nascended on high—this was the science of salvation that they were\nto learn and teach.\nThe warnings of the Word of God regarding the perils surround-\ning the Christian church belong to us today. As in the days of the\napostles men tried by tradition and philosophy to destroy faith in the\nScriptures, so today, by the pleasing sentiments of higher criticism,\nevolution, spiritualism, theosophy, andpantheism, theenemyofrigh-\nPaulWarnsAgainst“Tradition”and“Philosophy”,November26 697\nteousness is seeking to lead souls into forbidden paths. To many the\nBible is as a lamp without oil, because they have turned their minds\ninto channels of speculative belief that bring misunderstanding and\nconfusion.\nThe work of higher criticism, in dissecting, conjecturing, recon-\nstructing, is destroying faith in the Bible as a divine revelation. It is\nrobbing God’s Word of power to control, uplift, and inspire human\nlives. By spiritualism, multitudes are taught to believe that desire is\nthe highest law, that license is liberty, and that man is accountable\nonly to himself.... The power of a higher, purer, nobler life is our\ngreat need.—The Acts of the Apostles, 473-478.\n[345] The Essential Qualification for Service, November\nJesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me\nmore than these? He said unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest\nthat I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. John 21:15.\nLittle mention is made in the book of Acts of the later work\nof the apostle Peter.... As the number of believers multiplied in\nJerusalem and in other places visited by the messengers of the cross,\nthe talents possessed by Peter proved of untold value to the early\nChristian church. The influence of his testimony concerning Jesus of\nNazareth extended far and wide. Upon him had been laid a double\nresponsibility. He bore positive witness concerning the Messiah\nbefore unbelievers, laboring earnestly for their conversion; and at\nthe same time he did a special work for believers, strengthening\nthem in the faith of Christ.\nIt was after Peter had been led to self-renunciation and entire\nreliance upon divine power, that he received his call to act as an\nundershepherd. Christ had said to Peter, before his denial of Him,\n“When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren” (Luke 22:32).\nThese words were significant of the wide and effectual work which\nthis apostle was to do in the future for those who should come to the\nfaith.\nFor this work, Peter’s own experience of sin and suffering and\nrepentance had prepared him. Not until he had learned his weakness,\ncould he know the believer’s need of dependence on Christ. Amid\nthe storm of temptation he had come to understand that man can\nwalk safely only as in utter self-distrust he relies upon the Saviour....\nChrist mentioned to Peter only one condition of service—\n“Lovest thou me?” This is the essential qualification.... The love of\nChrist is not a fitful feeling, but a living principle, which is to be\nmade manifest as an abiding power in the heart...."

Hebrews 11:24, 25.\nYounger than Joseph or Daniel was Moses when removed from\nthe sheltering care of his childhood home; yet already the same\nagencies that shaped their lives had molded his. Only twelve years\ndid he spend with his Hebrew kindred; but during these years was\nlaid the foundation of his greatness; it was laid by the hand of one\nlittle known to fame.\nJochebed was a woman and a slave. Her lot in life was humble,\nher burden heavy. But through no other woman, save Mary of\nNazareth, has the world received greater blessing. Knowing that her\nchild must soon pass beyond her care, to the guardianship of those\nwho knew not God, she the more earnestly endeavored to link his\nsoul with heaven. She sought to implant in his heart love and loyalty\nto God. And faithfully was the work accomplished. Those principles\nof truth that were the burden of his mother’s teaching and the lesson\nof her life, no after influence could induce Moses to renounce.\nFrom the humble home in Goshen the son of Jochebed passed\nto the palace of the Pharaohs, to the Egyptian princess, by her to be\nwelcomed as a loved and cherished son. In the schools of Egypt,\nMoses received the highest civil and military training. Of great\npersonal attractions, noble in form and stature, of cultivated mind\nand princely bearing, and renowned as military leader, he became\nthe nation’s pride. The king of Egypt was also a member of the\npriesthood; and Moses, though refusing to participate in the heathen\nworship, was initiated into all the mysteries of the Egyptian religion.\nEgypt at this time being still the most powerful and most highly\ncivilized of nations, Moses, as its prospective sovereign, was heir\nto the highest honors this world could bestow. But his was a nobler\nJochebed’sInfluenceonMoses,November9 663\nchoice. ForthehonorofGodandthedeliveranceofHisdowntrodden\npeople, Moses sacrificed the honors of Egypt. Then, in a special\nsense, God undertook his training....\nHe had yet to learn the lesson of dependence upon divine\npower.... In the wilds of Midian, Moses spent forty years as a keeper\nof sheep.... In the care of the sheep and the tender lambs he must\nobtain the experience that would make him a faithful, long-suffering\nshepherd to Israel....\nAmidst the solemn majesty of the mountain solitudes, Moses\nwas alone with God.... Here his self-sufficiency was swept away.—\nEducation, 61-63.\nThe greatness of Egypt is in the dust.... But the work of Moses\ncan never perish. The great principles of righteousness which he\nlived to establish are eternal.—Education, 69.\n[328] Moses’ Leadership Inspired Confidence, November\nOg the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his\npeople to battle at Edrei. And the Lord said unto me; Fear him\nnot: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into\nthy hand.... And we smote him until none was left to him\nremaining. Deuteronomy 3:1-3.\nBefore them [Israel] lay the powerful and populous kingdom\nof Bashan, crowded with great stone cities that to this day excite\nthe wonder of the world.... The houses were constructed of huge\nblack stones, of such stupendous size as to make the buildings ab-\nsolutely impregnable to any force that in those times could have\nbeen brought against them. It was a country filled with wild caverns,\nlofty precipices, yawning gulfs, and rocky strongholds. The inhabi-\ntants of this land, descendants from a giant race, were themselves of\nmarvelous size and strength, and so distinguished for violence and\ncruelty as to be the terror of all surrounding nations; while Og, the\nking of the country, was remarkable for size and prowess, even in a\nnation of giants.\nBut the cloudy pillar moved forward, and following its guidance\nthe Hebrew hosts advanced to Edrei, where the giant king, with his\nforces, awaited their approach. Og had skillfully chosen the place of\nbattle. The city of Edrei was situated upon the border of a tableland\nrising abruptly from the plain, and covered with jagged, volcanic\nrocks. It could be approached only by narrow pathways....\nWhen the Hebrews looked upon the lofty form of that giant of\ngiants towering above the soldiers of his army; when they saw the\nhosts that surrounded him, and beheld the seemingly impregnable\nfortress, behind which unseen thousands were entrenched, the hearts\nof many in Israel quaked with fear. But Moses was calm and firm;\nthe Lord had said concerning the king of Bashan, “Fear him not: for\nI will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and"

When through Satan’s malice the servants of Christ\nhave been persecuted, their active labors hindered, when they have\nMeeknessUnderTrial,December11 729\nbeen cast into prison, or dragged to the scaffold or to the stake, it\nwas that truth might gain a greater triumph.

But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of\nChrist’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye\nmay be glad also with exceeding joy. 1 Peter 4:12, 13.\nLooking forward with prophetic vision to the perilous times\ninto which the church of Christ was to enter, the apostle [Peter] ex-\nhorted the believers to steadfastness in the face of trial and suffering.\n“Beloved,” he wrote, “think it not strange concerning the fiery trial\nwhich is to try you.”\nTrial is part of the education given in the school of Christ, to\npurify God’s children from the dross of earthliness. It is because\nGod is leading His children that trying experiences come to them.\nTrials and obstacles are His chosen methods of discipline, and His\nappointed conditions of success.\nHe who reads the hearts of men knows their weaknesses better\nthan they themselves can know them. He sees that some have quali-\nfications which, if rightly directed, could be used in the advancement\nof His work. In His providence He brings these souls into differ-\nent positions and varied circumstances, that they may discover the\ndefects that are concealed from their own knowledge. He gives\nthem opportunity to overcome these defects and to fit themselves\nfor service. Often He permits the fires of affliction to burn, that they\nmay be purified.\nGod’s care for His heritage is unceasing. He suffers not affliction\nto come upon His children but such as is essential for their present\nand eternal good. He will purify His church, even as Christ purified\nthe temple during His ministry on earth. All that He brings upon His\npeople in test and trial comes that they may gain deeper piety and\ngreater strength to carry forward the triumphs of the cross."

The soul,\ncorrupted and deformed, is to be purified, transformed, that it may\nbe clothed in “the beauty of the Lord our God,” “conformed to the\nimage of his Son.” “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have\nentered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared\nfor them that love him” (Psalm 90:17; Romans 8:29; 1 Corinthians\n2:9). Eternity alone can reveal the glorious destiny to which man,\nrestored to God’s image, may attain.\nIn order for us to reach this high ideal, that which causes the soul\nto stumble must be sacrificed. It is through the will that sin retains\nits hold upon us.... Often it seems to us that to surrender the will to\nGod is to consent to go through life maimed or crippled.

This\nestablishes a new record in the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and\nprobably is a record also in the Christian world at large. Ellen\nWhite’s writings are at once so voluminous, so Christ-centered, and\nso practical that they continue to provide an almost endless source\nof materials that are admirably suited for devotional reading.\nDuring her seventy-year ministry the author spoke, through her\npen, to young people, to church members, and to the world in the\nYouth’s Instructor, Review and Herald, and Signs of the Times. Se-\nlections for this book have been drawn from these three periodicals\nas well as from her books and previously unpublished manuscripts\nand letters.\nIn order to bring each reading within the compass of a single\npage, frequent deletions have been necessary. Such omissions are\nindicated by marks of ellipsis. In every instance great care has been\nexercised to preserve without distortion the thought and intent of\nthe writer. Reflecting Christ—the title of this book—is a theme\nthat recurs constantly through the writings of Ellen White. Loving\nthe Lord deeply, the author earnestly endeavored to walk in his\nfootsteps herself, and she ever encouraged others to look to Christ\nas their example. Underlining the theme of this book, she wrote:\n“When those who profess to serve God follow Christ’s example,\npracticing the principles of the law in their daily life; when every act\nbears witness that they love God supremely and their neighbor as\nthemselves, then will the church have power to move the world.”—\nChrist’s Object Lessons, 340.\nReflecting Christ—this should be every Christian’s highest goal.\nThe pursuit of this objective, under the impetus of the indwelling\nspirit of God and the grace of Christ, can bring with it only peace\nand true happiness.\nxiv\nForeword xv\nThat the meditations in this book may aid and encourage each\nreader in his or her walk with the Lord is the fervent prayer of\nThe Trustees of the ELlen G.
