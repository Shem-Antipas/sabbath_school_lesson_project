John\n17:5, RSV.\nWhile God’s Word speaks of the humanity of Christ when upon\nthis earth, it also speaks decidedly regarding His pre-existence. The\nWord existed as a divine being, even as the eternal Son of God,\nin union and oneness with His Father. From everlasting He was\nthe Mediator of the covenant, the one in whom all nations of the\nearth, both Jews and Gentiles, if they accepted Him, were to be\nblessed. “The Word was with God, and the Word was God” (John\n1:1). Before men or angels were created, the Word was with God,\nand was God.\nThe world was made by Him, “and without Him was not any\nthing made that was made” (verse 3). If Christ made all things, He\nexisted before all things. The words spoken in regard to this are so\ndecisivethatnooneneedbeleftindoubt. ChristwasGodessentially,\nand in the highest sense. He was with God from all eternity, God\nover all, blessed forevermore.\nThe Lord Jesus Christ, the divine Son of God, existed from\neternity, a distinct person, yet one with the Father. He was the\nsurpassing glory of heaven. He was the commander of the heavenly\nintelligences, and the adoring homage of the angels was received by\nHim as His right. This was no robbery of God. “The Lord possessed\nme in the beginning of his way,” He declares, “before his works of\nold. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the\nearth was. When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when\nthere were no fountains abounding with water. Before the mountains\nwere settled, before the hills was I brought forth: while as yet he had\nnot made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of\nthe world. When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set\na compass upon the face of the depths” (Proverbs 8:22-27).\nPre-ExistenceoftheSonofGod,January2 19\nThere are light and glory in the truth that Christ was one with\nthe Father before the foundation of the world was laid. This is the\nlight shining in a dark place, making it resplendent with divine,\noriginal glory. This truth, infinitely mysterious in itself, explains\nother mysterious and otherwise unexplainable truths, while it is\nenshrined in light, unapproachable and incomprehensible....\n“The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them\nwhich sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up”\n(Matthew 4:16). Here the preexistence of Christ and the purpose of\nHis manifestation to our world are presented as living beams of light\nfrom the eternal throne (Selected Messages 1:247, 248).\n[Christ] says, and let My glory shine forth—the glory which I\nhad with Thee before the world was (The Signs of the Times, May\n10, 1899)."

Philippians 2:5, 6.\nLucifer in heaven, before his rebellion, was a high and exalted\nangel, next in honor to God’s dear Son. His countenance, like those\nof the other angels, was mild and expressive of happiness. His\nforehead was high and broad, showing a powerful intellect. His\nform was perfect; his bearing noble and majestic. A special light\nbeamed in his countenance and shone around him brighter and more\nbeautiful than around the other angels; yet Christ, God’s dear Son,\nhad the preeminence over all the angelic host. He was one with the\nFather before the angels were created. Lucifer was envious of Christ,\nand gradually assumed command which devolved on Christ alone.\nThe great Creator assembled the heavenly host, that He might\nin the presence of all the angels confer special honor upon His Son.\nThe Son was seated on the throne with the Father, and the heavenly\nthrong of holy angels was gathered around them. The Father then\nmade known that it was ordained by Himself that Christ, His Son,\nshould be equal with Himself; so that wherever was the presence of\nHis Son, it was as His own presence. The word of the Son was to be\nobeyed as readily as the word of the Father. His Son He had invested\nwith authority to command the heavenly host. Especially was His\nSon to work in union with Himself in the anticipated creation of the\nearth and every living thing that should exist upon the earth. His Son\nwould carry out His will and His purposes but would do nothing of\nHimself alone. The Father’s will would be fulfilled in Him.\nLucifer was envious and jealous of Jesus Christ. Yet when all\nthe angels bowed to Jesus to acknowledge His supremacy and high\nauthority and rightful rule, he bowed with them; but his heart was\nfilled with envy and hatred....\nEqualWiththeFather,January4 23\nAngels that were loyal and true sought to reconcile this mighty,\nrebellious angel to the will of his Creator. They justified the act of\nGod in conferring honor upon Christ, and with forcible reasoning\nsought to convince Lucifer that no less honor was his now than\nbefore the Father had proclaimed the honor which He had conferred\nupon His Son. They clearly set forth that Christ was the Son of\nGod, existing with Him before the angels were created; and that\nHe had ever stood at the right hand of God, and His mild, loving\nauthority had not heretofore been questioned; and that He had given\nno commands but what it was joy for the heavenly host to execute.\nThey urged that Christ’s receiving special honor from the Father, in\nthepresenceoftheangels, didnotdetractfromthehonorthatLucifer\nhad heretofore received. The angels wept. They anxiously sought\nto move him to renounce his wicked design and yield submission\nto their Creator; for all had heretofore been peace and harmony....\nLucifer refused to listen (The Story of Redemption, 13-16)."

The\nmighty revolter then declared that he was acquainted with God’s\nlaw, and if he should submit to servile obedience, his honor would\nbe taken from him. No more would he be entrusted with his exalted\nmission. He told them that himself and they also had now gone too\nfar to go back, and he would brave the consequences, for to bow in\nservile worship to the Son of God he never would; that God would\nnot forgive, and now they must assert their liberty and gain by force\nthe position and authority which was not willingly accorded to them.\nThe loyal angels hastened speedily to the Son of God and ac-\nquainted Him with what was taking place among the angels.

It would not have been safe to suffer any who united\nwith Satan in his rebellion to continue to occupy heaven. They had\nlearned the lesson of genuine rebellion against the unchangeable law\nof God, and this is incurable....\nThen there was war in heaven. The Son of God, the Prince of\nheaven, and His loyal angels engaged in conflict with the archrebel\nand those who united with him. The Son of God and true, loyal\nangels prevailed; andSatan andhis sympathizers were expelledfrom\nTreasoninHeaven,January5 25\nheaven.

The working out of Satan’s rule, its effects upon\nboth men and angels, would show what must be the fruit of setting\naside the divine authority. It would testify that with the existence of\nGod’s government is bound up the well-being of all the creatures He\nhas made (Patriarchs and Prophets, 42, 43)."

        "content": "Every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the\nsame sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But when\nChrist had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat\ndown at the right hand of God. Hebrews 10:11, 12, RSV.\nIn patriarchal times the sacrificial offerings connected with di-\nvine worship constituted a perpetual reminder of the coming of\na Saviour, and thus it was with the entire ritual of the sanctuary\nservices throughout Israel’s history. In the ministration of the taber-\nnacle, and of the Temple that afterward took its place, the people\nwere taught each day, by means of types and shadows, the great\ntruths relative to the advent of Christ as Redeemer, Priest, and King;\nand once each year their minds were carried forward to the closing\nevents of the great controversy between Christ and Satan, the final\npurification of the universe from sin and sinners.\nThe sacrifices and offerings of the Mosaic ritual were ever point-\ning toward a better service, even a heavenly. The earthly sanctuary\nwas “a figure for the time then present,” in which were offered both\ngifts and sacrifices; its two holy places were “patterns of things in\nthe heavens”; for Christ, our great High Priest, is today “a minister\nof the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched,\nand not man” (Hebrews 9:9, 23; 8:2).\nFrom the day the Lord declared to the serpent in Eden, “I will\nput enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and\nher seed” (Genesis 3:15), Satan has known that he can never hold\nabsolute sway over the inhabitants of this world. When Adam and\nhis sons began to offer the ceremonial sacrifices ordained by God as\na type of the coming Redeemer, Satan discerned in these a symbol\nof communion between earth and heaven. During the long centuries\nthat have followed, it has been his constant effort to intercept this\nSacrificesandOrdinancesRevealedGod’sDivineLove,January12 39\ncommunion. Untiringly has he sought to misrepresent God and to\nmisinterpret the rites pointing to the Saviour....\nWhile God has desired to teach men that from His own love\ncomes the Gift which reconciles them to Himself, the archenemy\nof mankind has endeavored to represent God as one who delights\nin their destruction. Thus the sacrifices and ordinances designed\nof Heaven to reveal divine love have been perverted (Prophets and\nKings, 684-686).\nIn word and in deed the Messiah, during His earthly ministry,\nwas to reveal to mankind the glory of God the Father. Every act of\nHis life, every word spoken, every miracle wrought, was to make\nknown to fallen humanity the infinite love of God....\nThus, through patriarchs and prophets, as well as through types\nand symbols, God spoke to the world concerning the coming of a\nDeliverer from sin (Prophets and Kings, 696, 697)."

Romans 5:5, 6.\nThrough the long centuries of “trouble and darkness” and “dim-\nness of anguish” (Isaiah 8:22) marking the history of mankind from\nthe day our first parents lost their Eden home, to the time the Son of\nGod appeared as the Saviour of sinners, the hope of the fallen race\nwas centered in the coming of a Deliverer to free men and women\nfrom the bondage of sin and the grave.\nThe first intimation of such a hope was given to Adam and Eve\nin the sentence pronounced upon the serpent in Eden when the Lord\ndeclared to Satan in their hearing, “I will put enmity between thee\nand the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise\nthy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel” (Genesis 3:15).\nAs the guilty pair listened to these words, they were inspired\nwith hope; for in the prophecy concerning the breaking of Satan’s\npowertheydiscernedapromiseofdeliverancefrom theruin wrought\nthrough transgression.

The Son of God was offering to atone\nwith His own lifeblood for their transgression. To them was to be\ngranted a period of probation, during which, through faith in the\npower of Christ to save, they might become once more the children\nof God.\nSatan, by means of his success in turning man aside from the\npath of obedience, became “the god of this world” (2 Corinthians\n4:4). The dominion that once was Adam’s passed to the usurper. But\nthe Son of God proposed to come to this earth to pay the penalty\nof sin, and thus not only redeem man, but recover the dominion\nHopeoftheAges,January13 41\nforfeited. It is of this restoration that Micah prophesied when he\nsaid, “O Tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion,\nunto thee shall it come, even the first dominion” (Micah 4:8)....\nThis hope of redemption through the advent of the Son of God\nas Saviour and King has never become extinct in the hearts of men.\nFrom the beginning there have been some whose faith has reached\nout beyond the shadows of the present to the realities of the future.\nAdam, Seth, Enoch, Methuselah, Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, and\nJacob—through these and other worthies the Lord has preserved the\nprecious revealings of His will. And it was thus that to the children\nof Israel ... God imparted a knowledge of the requirements of His\nlaw, and of the salvation to be accomplished through the atoning\nsacrifice of His beloved Son (Prophets and Kings, 681-683)."

With Christ the enmity was in one\nsense natural; in another sense it was supernatural, as humanity and\ndivinity were combined. And never was the enmity developed to\nsuch a marked degree as when Christ became an inhabitant of this\nearth. Never before had there been a being upon the earth who hated\nsin with so perfect a hatred as did Christ. He had seen its deceiving,\ninfatuating power upon the holy angels, and all His powers were\nenlisted against it.\nThe purity and holiness of Christ, the spotless righteousness\nof Him who did no sin, was a perpetual reproach upon all sin in\na world of sensuality and sin. In His life the light of truth was\nflashed amid the moral darkness with which Satan had enshrouded\nthe world. Christ exposed Satan’s falsehoods and deceiving charac-\nter, and in many hearts destroyed his corrupting influence. It was\nthis that stirred Satan with such intense hatred. With his hosts of\nfallen beings he determined to urge the warfare most vigorously;\nfor there stood in the world One who was a perfect representative\nof the Father, One whose character and practices refuted Satan’s\nmisrepresentation of God. Satan had charged upon God the attribute\nhe himself possessed. Now in Christ he saw God revealed in His\ntrue character—a compassionate, merciful Father, not willing that\nTrueCharacterofGodinChrist,January14 43\nany should perish, but that all should come to Him in repentance,\nand have eternal life.\nIntense worldliness has been one of Satan’s most successful\ntemptations. He designs to keep the hearts and minds of men so\nengrossed with worldly attractions that there will be no room for\nheavenly things. He controls their minds in their love of the world.\nEarthly things eclipse the heavenly, and put the Lord out of their\nsight and understanding....\nSatan reached only the heel; he could not touch the head. At\nthe death of Christ, Satan saw that he was defeated. He saw that\nhis true character was clearly revealed before all heaven, and that\nthe heavenly beings and the worlds that God had created would be\nwholly on the side of God.... Christ’s humanity would demonstrate\nfor eternal ages the question which settled the controversy (Selected\nMessages 1:254, 255)."

On one occasion, shortly\nbefore his death, Moses declared, “The Lord thy God will raise up\nunto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto\nme; unto him ye shall hearken.” Plainly had Moses been instructed\nfor Israel concerning the work of the Messiah to come. “I will raise\nthem up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee,” was\nthe word of Jehovah to His servant; “and will put my words in his\nmouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him”\n(Deuteronomy 18:15, 18) (Prophets and Kings, 683, 684).\nAbout 40 days after the birth of Christ, Joseph and Mary took\nHimtoJerusalem, topresentHimtotheLord, andtooffersacrifice....\nThe priest went through the ceremony of his official work.

He did not think that this babe was He\nwhose glory Moses had asked to see.

Hebrews 2:18, RSV.\nIf, under trying circumstances, men of spiritual power, pressed\nbeyond measure, become discouraged and desponding, if at times\nthey see nothing desirable in life, that they should choose it, this is\nnothing strange or new. Let all such remember that one of the might-\niest of the prophets fled for his life before the rage of an infuriated\nwoman. A fugitive, weary and travel-worn, bitter disappointment\ncrushing his spirits, he asked that he might die. But it was when\nhope was gone and his lifework seemed threatened with defeat, that\nhe learned one of the most precious lessons of his life. In the hour\nof his greatest weakness he learned the need and the possibility of\ntrusting God under circumstances the most forbidding.\nThose who, while spending their life energies in self-sacrificing\nlabor, are tempted to give way to despondency and distrust may\ngather courage from the experience of Elijah. God’s watchful care,\nHis love, His power, are especially manifest in behalf of His servants\nwhose zeal is misunderstood or unappreciated, whose counsels and\nreproofs are slighted, and whose efforts toward reform are repaid\nwith hatred and opposition.\nIt is at the time of greatest weakness that Satan assails the soul\nwith the fiercest temptations. It was thus that he hoped to prevail\nover the Son of God; for by this policy he had gained many victories\nover man. When the willpower weakened and faith failed, then those\nwho had stood long and valiantly for the right yielded to temptation.\nMoses, wearied with 40 years of wandering and unbelief, lost for\na moment his hold on Infinite Power. He failed just on the borders\nof the Promised Land. So with Elijah. He who had maintained his\ntrust in Jehovah during the years of drought and famine, he who had\nstood undaunted before Ahab, he who throughout that trying day on\nCarmel had stood before the whole nation of Israel the sole witness\nAssailedWiththeFiercestTemptations,January25 65\nto the true God, in a moment of weariness allowed the fear of death\nto overcome his faith in God. And so it is today....\nThose who, standing in the forefront of the conflict, are impelled\nby the Holy Spirit to do a special work will frequently feel a reac-\ntion when the pressure is removed. Despondency may shake the\nmost heroic faith and weaken the most steadfast will. But God un-\nderstands, and He still pities and loves. He reads the motives and\nthe purposes of the heart.... Heaven will not fail them in their day\nof adversity.

He heard the voice of Christ saying, “I am the way, the\ntruth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”\nHe determined to avail himself of the benefits of saving grace, to\nbecome dead to trespasses and sins, to have his guilt washed away\nin the blood of Christ, to be clothed with Christ’s righteousness, to\nbecome a branch of the Living Vine.

Ephesians 5:2, RSV.\nThe world that Satan has claimed and has ruled over with cruel\ntyranny, the Son of God has, by one vast achievement, encircled in\nHis love and connected again with the throne of Jehovah. Cherubim\nand seraphim, and the unnumbered hosts of all the unfallen worlds,\nsang anthems of praise to God and the Lamb when this triumph was\nassured. They rejoiced that the way of salvation had been opened to\nthe fallen race and that the earth would be redeemed from the curse\nof sin. How much more should those rejoice who are the objects of\nsuch amazing love!\nHow can we ever be in doubt and uncertainty, and feel that we\nare orphans? It was in behalf of those who had transgressed the law\nthat Jesus took upon Him human nature; He became like unto us,\nthat we might have everlasting peace and assurance....\nThe very first step in approaching God is to know and believe\nthe love that He has to us (1 John 4:16); for it is through the drawing\nof His love that we are led to come to Him.\nThe perception of God’s love works the renunciation of selfish-\nness. In calling God our Father, we recognize all His children as our\nbrethren. We are all a part of the great web of humanity, all members\nof one family. In our petitions we are to include our neighbors as\nwell as ourselves. No one prays aright who seeks a blessing for\nhimself alone.\nThe infinite God, said Jesus, makes it your privilege to approach\nHim by the name of Father. Understand all that this implies. No\nearthly parents ever pleaded so earnestly with an erring child as He\nwho made you pleads with the transgressor. No human, loving inter-\nest ever followed the impenitent with such tender invitations. God\ndwells in every abode; He hears every word that is spoken, listens to\nevery prayer that is offered, tastes the sorrows and disappointments\nEncircledWithHisLove,January31 77\nof every soul, regards the treatment that is given to father, mother,\nsister, friend, and neighbor. He cares for our necessities, and His\nlove and mercy and grace are continually flowing to satisfy our need.\nBut if you call God your Father you acknowledge yourselves\nHis children, to be guided by His wisdom and to be obedient in all\nthings, knowing that His love is changeless. You will accept His\nplan for your life. As children of God, you will hold His honor,\nHis character, His family, His work, as the objects of your highest\ninterest. It will be your joy to recognize and honor your relation to\nyour Father and to every member of His family. You will rejoice\nto do any act, however humble, that will tend to His glory or to the\nwell-being of your kindred (Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,\n104-106).\n78 LiftHimUp\nFebruary—Lift Him Up as the Creator"

Psalm 102:25, NIV.\nIn the beginning, God was revealed in all the works of creation.\nIt was Christ that spread the heavens, and laid the foundations of the\nearth. It was His hand that hung the worlds in space, and fashioned\nthe flowers of the field. “His strength setteth fast the mountains.”\n“The sea is his, and he made it” (Psalm 65:6; 95:5). It was He\nthat filled the earth with beauty, and the air with song. And upon\nall things in earth, and air, and sky, He wrote the messages of the\nFather’s love.\nNow sin has marred God’s perfect work, yet that handwriting\nremains. Even now all created things declare the glory of His ex-\ncellence. There is nothing, save the selfish heart of man, that lives\nunto itself. No bird that cleaves the air, no animal that moves upon\nthe ground, but ministers to some other life. There is no leaf of the\nforest, or lowly blade of grass, but has its ministry. Every tree and\nshrub and leaf pours forth that element of life without which neither\nman nor animal could live; and man and animal, in turn, minister to\nthe life of tree and shrub and leaf. The flowers breathe fragrance and\nunfold their beauty in blessing to the world. The sun sheds its light\nto gladden a thousand worlds. The ocean, itself the source of all\nour springs and fountains, receives the streams from every land, but\ntakes to give. The mists ascending from its bosom fall in showers to\nwater the earth, that it may bring forth and bud.\nThe angels of glory find their joy in giving—giving love and\ntireless watchcare to souls that are fallen and unholy. Heavenly\nbeings woo the hearts of men; they bring to this dark world light\nfrom the courts above; by gentle and patient ministry they move\nupon the human spirit, to bring the lost into a fellowship with Christ\nwhich is even closer than they themselves can know.\nLawofLifefortheUniverse,February1 81\nBut turning from all lesser representations, we behold God in\nJesus. Looking unto Jesus we see that it is the glory of our God to\ngive. “I do nothing of myself,” said Christ; “the living Father hath\nsent me, and I live by the Father.” “I seek not mine own glory,” but\nthe glory of Him that sent Me. In these words is set forth the great\nprinciple which is the law of life for the universe. All things Christ\nreceived from God, but He took to give. So in the heavenly courts,\nin His ministry for all created beings: through the beloved Son, the\nFather’s life flows out to all; through the Son it returns, in praise and\njoyous service, a tide of love, to the great Source of all. And thus\nthrough Christ the circuit of beneficence is complete, representing\nthe character of the great Giver, the law of life (The Desire of Ages,\n20, 21)."

        "verse_ref": " Revelation 14:7",
        "content": "The duty to worship God is based upon the fact that He is the\nCreator and that to Him all other beings owe their existence. And\nwherever, in the Bible, His claim to reverence and worship, above\nthe gods of the heathen, is presented, there is cited the evidence of\nHis creative power. “All the gods of the nations are idols: but the\nLord made the heavens” (Psalm 96:5). “To whom then will ye liken\nme, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on\nhigh, and behold who hath created these things.” “Thus saith the\nLord that created the heavens; God Himself that formed the earth\nand made it: ... I am the Lord; and there is none else” (Isaiah 40:25,\n26; 45:18).\nSays the psalmist: “Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is he that\nhath made us, and not we ourselves.” “O come, let us worship and\nbow down: let us kneel before the Lord our maker” (Psalm 100:3;\n95:6). And the holy beings who worship God in heaven state, as\nthe reason why their homage is due to Him: “Thou art worthy, O\nLord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created\nall things” (Revelation 4:11).\nIn Revelation 14, men are called upon to worship the Creator;\nand the prophecy brings to view a class that, as the result of the\nthreefold message, are keeping the commandments of God. One\nof these commandments points directly to God as the Creator. The\nfourth precept declares: “The seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord\nthy God: ... for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea,\nand all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the\nLord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it” (Exodus 20:10, 11).\nConcerning the Sabbath, the Lord says, further, that it is “a sign, ...\nthat ye may know that I am the Lord your God” (Ezekiel 20:20).\nAnd the reason given is: “For in six days the Lord made heaven and\nWorshiptheCreator,February6 91\nearth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed” (Exodus\n31:17)....\nSo long as the fact that He is our Creator continues to be a reason\nwhy we should worship Him, so long the Sabbath will continue as\nits sign and memorial. Had the Sabbath been universally kept, man’s\nthoughts and affections would have been led to the Creator as an\nobject of reverence and worship, and there would never have been\nan idolater, an atheist, or an infidel. The keeping of the Sabbath is a\nsign of loyalty to the true God, “him that made heaven, and earth,\nand the sea, and the fountains of waters.” It follows that the message\nwhich commands men to worship God and keep His commandments\nwillespecially callupon them to keep the fourthcommandment(The\nGreat Controversy, 436-438)."

He then, in\ngiving the reason for thus observing the week, points them back to\nHis example on the first seven days of time. “For in six days the\nLord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and\nrested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day\nand hallowed it.”\nThis reason appears beautiful and forcible when we understand\nthe record of Creation to mean literal days. The first six days of each\nweek are given to man in which to labor, because God employed the\nsame period of the first week in the work of creation. The seventh\nday God has reserved as a day of rest, in commemoration of His rest\nduring the same period of time after He had performed the work of\ncreation in six days.\nBut the infidel supposition, that the events of the first week\nrequired seven vast, indefinite periods for their accomplishment,\nstrikes directly at the foundation of the Sabbath of the fourth com-\nmandment. It makes indefinite and obscure that which God has\nmade very plain....\nInfidel geologists claim that the world is very much older than\nthe Bible record makes it. They reject the Bible record, because\nof those things which are to them evidences from the earth itself,\nthat the world has existed tens of thousands of years. And many\nEarth’sFirstWeek,February7 93\nwho profess to believe the Bible record are at a loss to account for\nwonderful things which are found in the earth, with the view that\nCreation week was only seven literal days, and the world is now\nonly about 6000 years old....\nWithout Bible history, geology can prove nothing. Relics found\nin the earth do give evidence of a state of things differing in many\nrespects from the present. But the time of their existence, and\nhow long a period these things have been in the earth, are only\nto be understood by Bible history.... When men leave the Word\nof God in regard to the history of Creation, and seek to account\nfor God’s creative works upon natural principles, they are upon a\nboundless ocean of uncertainty. Just how God accomplished the\nwork of Creation in six literal days He has never revealed to mortals.\nHis creative works are just as incomprehensible as His existence\n(Spiritual Gifts 3:90-93)."

The evening had been calm\nand pleasant, and quiet rested upon the lake; but suddenly darkness\noverspread the sky, the windswept wildly down the mountain gorges\nalong the eastern shore, and a fierce tempest burst upon the lake....\nThe waves, lashed into fury by the howling winds, dashed\nfiercely over the disciples’ boat, and threatened to engulf it. Those\nhardy fishermen had spent their lives upon the lake, and had guided\ntheir craft safely through many a storm; but now their strength and\nskill availed nothing. They were helpless in the grasp of the tempest,\nand hope failed them as they saw that their boat was filling.\nAbsorbed in their efforts to save themselves, they had forgotten\nthat Jesus was on board. Now, seeing their labor vain and only death\nbefore them, they remembered at whose command they had set out\nto cross the sea. In Jesus was their only hope. In their helplessness\nand despair they cried, “Master, Master!” But the dense darkness\nhid Him from their sight. Their voices were drowned by the roaring\nof the tempest....\nPowerOvertheTempest,February12 103\nSuddenly a flash of lightning pierces the darkness, and they see\nJesus lying asleep, undisturbed by the tumult. In amazement and\ndespair they exclaim, “Master, carest thou not that we perish?” ...\nAs the lightning’s glare reveals Him, they see the peace of heaven\nin His face; they read in His glance self-forgetful, tender love, and,\ntheir hearts turning to Him, cry, “Lord, save us: we perish.”\nNever did a soul utter that cry unheeded. As the disciples grasp\ntheir oars to make a last effort, Jesus rises. He stands in the midst of\nHis disciples, while the tempest rages.... He lifts His hand, so often\nemployed in deeds of mercy, and says to the angry sea, “Peace, be\nstill”.... As Jesus rested by faith in the Father’s care, so we are to\nrest in the care of our Saviour (The Desire of Ages, 333-336)."

The\nsame great laws that guide alike the star and the atom control human\nlife. The laws that govern the heart’s action, regulating the flow of\nthe current of life to the body, are the laws of the mighty Intelligence\nthat has the jurisdiction of the soul. From Him all life proceeds.\nOnly in harmony with Him can be found its true sphere of action.\nFor all the objects of His creation the condition is the same—a life\nGod’sPowerinNatureandUs,February23 125\nsustained by receiving the life of God, a life exercised in harmony\nwith the Creator’s will. To transgress His law, physical, mental, or\nmoral, is to place one’s self out of harmony with the universe, to\nintroduce discord, anarchy, ruin.\nTo him who learns thus to interpret its teachings, all nature\nbecomes illuminated; the world is a lesson book, life a school. The\nunity of man with nature and with God, the universal dominion of\nlaw, the results of transgression, cannot fail of impressing the mind\nand molding the character.\nAs the dwellers in Eden learned from nature’s pages, as Moses\ndiscerned God’s handwriting on the Arabian plains and mountains,\nand the Child Jesus on the hillsides of Nazareth, so the children of\ntoday may learn of Him. The unseen is illustrated by the seen. On\neverything upon the earth ... from the boundless ocean to the tiniest\nshell on the shore, they may behold the image and superscription of\nGod (Education, 99, 100)."

        "content": "In the East the state of affairs was so unsettled, and there was so\ngreat danger from violence that the people dwelt chiefly in walled\ntowns, and the husbandmen went forth daily to their labor outside\nthe walls. So Christ, the heavenly Sower, went forth to sow. He left\nHis home of security and peace, left the glory that He had with the\nFather before the world was, left His position upon the throne of the\nuniverse. He went forth, a suffering, tempted man; went forth in\nsolitude, to sow in tears, to water with His blood, the seed of life for\na world lost.\nHis servants in like manner must go forth to sow. When called\nto become a sower of the seed of truth, Abraham was bidden, “Get\nthee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s\nhouse, unto a land that I will shew thee” (Genesis 12:1). “And he\nwent out, not knowing whither he went” (Hebrews 11:8).... In toil\nand tears, in solitude, and through sacrifice, must the seed be sown.\n“The sower soweth the word.” Christ came to sow the world with\ntruth. Ever since the Fall of man, Satan has been sowing the seeds\nof error. It was by a lie that he first gained control over men, and\nthus he still works to overthrow God’s kingdom in the earth and to\nbring men under his power. A sower from a higher world, Christ\ncame to sow the seeds of truth. He who had stood in the councils\nof God, who had dwelt in the innermost sanctuary of the Eternal,\ncould bring to men the pure principles of truth. Ever since the Fall of\nman, Christ had been the Revealer of truth to the world. By Him the\nincorruptible seed, “the word of God, which liveth and abideth for\never,” is communicated to men (1 Peter 1:23). In that first promise\nspoken to our fallen race in Eden, Christ was sowing the gospel seed.\nBut it is to His personal ministry among men, and to the work which\nHe thus established, that the parable of the sower especially applies.\n126"

In like manner those\nwho are just converted to Christ are, “as newborn babes,” to “grow\nup” to the stature of men and women in Christ Jesus (1 Peter 2:2;\nEphesians 4:15). Or like the good seed sown in the field, they are to\ngrow up and bring forth fruit. Isaiah says that they shall “be called\ntrees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be\nglorified” (Isaiah 61:3). So from natural life, illustrations are drawn,\nto help us better to understand the mysterious truths of spiritual life.\nNot all the wisdom and skill of man can produce life in the\nsmallest object in nature. It is only through the life which God\nHimself has imparted, that either plant or animal can live. So it\nis only through the life from God that spiritual life is begotten in\nthe hearts of men. Unless a man is “born from above,” he cannot\nbecome a partaker of the life which Christ came to give (John 3:3,\nmargin).\nAs with life, so it is with growth. It is God who brings the bud\nto bloom and the flower to fruit. It is by His power that the seed\ndevelops, “first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the\near” (Mark 4:28). And the prophet Hosea says of Israel, that “he\nshall grow as the lily” (Hosea 14:5). “They shall revive as the corn,\nand grow as the vine” (verse 7). And Jesus bids us “consider the\nlilies how they grow” (Luke 12:27). The plants and flowers grow not\nby their own care or anxiety or effort, but by receiving that which\nGod has furnished to minister to their life. The child cannot, by any\nanxiety or power of its own, add to its stature. No more can you, by\nanxiety or effort of yourself, secure spiritual growth. The plant, the\nchild, grows by receiving from its surroundings that which ministers\nGrowthComesfromGod,February25 129\nto its life—air, sunshine, and food. What these gifts of nature are to\nanimal and plant, such is Christ to those who trust in Him....\nIn the matchless gift of His Son, God has encircled the whole\nworld with an atmosphere of grace as real as the air which circulates\naround the globe. All who choose to breathe this life-giving atmo-\nsphere will live and grow up to the stature of men and women in\nChrist Jesus.\nAs the flower turns to the sun, that the bright beams may aid in\nperfecting its beauty and symmetry, so should we turn to the Sun\nof Righteousness, that heaven’s light may shine upon us, that our\ncharacter may be developed into the likeness of Christ (Steps to\nChrist, 67, 68)."

When you deliberately decide to go contrary\nto the word spoken by Jesus Christ, “Seek ye first the kingdom of\nGod, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto\nyou,” how can you expect to be religiously inclined?\nTo enlarge our views of His condescension and beneficence, He\npresents the picture of the judgment—the separation of the just and\nthe unjust—and shows us He identifies His interests with suffering\nhumanity. He is teaching in the open field where the eye can take in\nthe beauties of nature and the creatures of God’s creation. “Consider\nthe ravens: for they neither sow nor reap: ... how much more are ye\nbetter than the fowls? And which of you with taking thought can\nadd to his stature one cubit? If ye then be not able to do that thing\nwhich is least, why take ye thought for the rest?” (Luke 12:24-26).\nHere is presented definitely that man is dependent upon God\nfor every breath he draws. The beating heart, the throbbing pulse,\nevery nerve and muscle in the living organism, are kept in order and\nactivity by the power of an infinite God. “Consider the lilies of the\nfield, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I\nsay unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed\nlike one of these. Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field,\nwhich today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much\nmore clothe you, O ye of little faith? Therefore take no thought,\nsaying, What shallwe eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal\nshall we be clothed? (for after all these things do the Gentiles seek:)\nfor your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these\nthings. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness,\nand all these things shall be added unto you” (Matthew 6:28-33).\nTotallyDependentUpontheCreator,February26 131\nHere Christ leads the mind abroad to contemplate the open fields\nof nature, and His power touches the eye and the senses, to discern\nthe wonderful works of divine power. He directs attention first to\nnature, then up through nature to nature’s God, who upholds the\nworlds by His power. He points to the opening bud.... He watches\nover little birds. Not a sparrow falleth to the ground without the\nnotice of your heavenly Father....\nChrist represents the divine attention given upon [various ele-\nments of] His creation that seem so insignificant, and to the objects\nof nature which His own hands have created. Every lofty tree, every\nshrub, every blooming flower, the lily of the field, and the earth\nclothed with its garment of living green are kept in order and oc-\ncupy their time and season to bear testimony that God loves man\n(Manuscript 73, 1893)."

He\n“so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.” John\npresents this wonderful subject with such simplicity that all may\ngrasp the ideas set forth, and be enlightened.\nChrist did not make-believe take human nature; He did verily\ntake it.

He was to come as\none of the human family, and to stand as a man before heaven and\nearth. He had come to take man’s place, to pledge Himself in man’s\nbehalf, to pay the debt that sinners owed.

Luke 3:21, NKJV.\nWhen Jesus came to be baptized, John recognized in Him a\npurity of character that he had never before perceived in any man.\nThe very atmosphere of His presence was holy and awe-inspiring.\nAmong the multitudes that had gathered about him at the Jordan,\nJohn had heard dark tales of crime, and had met souls bowed down\nwiththeburdenofmyriadsins; butneverhadhecomeincontactwith\na human being from whom there breathedan influence so divine.

He identified Himself with sinners, taking the steps that we\nare to take, and doing the work that we must do. His life of suffering\nand patient endurance after His baptism was also an example to us.\nUpon coming up out of the water, Jesus bowed in prayer on the\nriver bank. A new and important era was opening before Him (The\nDesire of Ages, 110, 111).\nNever had angels listened to such a prayer. They were solicitous\nto bear to the praying Redeemer messages of assurance and love.\nBut no; the Father Himself will minister to His Son.

Their\neyes were fastened upon Christ, whose bowed form was bathed in\nthe beautiful light and glory that ever surround the throne of God.\nHis upturned face was glorified as they had never before seen the\nJesusAssuredofHisSonship,March5 147\nface of man.

At the very commencement of His\npublic ministry, He presents Himself in the character He sustains to\nman throughout His mediatorial work.

The first great\ntemptation was upon appetite; the second, presumption; the third,\nlove of the world. Satan has overcome his millions by tempting\nthem to the indulgence of appetite. Through the gratification of\nthe taste, the nervous system becomes excited and the brain power\nenfeebled, making it impossible to think calmly or rationally. The\nmindis unbalanced. Its higher, noblerfacultiesare pervertedtoserve\nanimal lusts, and the sacred, eternal interests are not regarded. When\nthis object is gained, Satan can come with his two other leading\ntemptations and find ready access. His manifold temptations grow\nout of these three great leading points.\nPresumption is a common temptation, and as Satan assails men\nwith this, he obtains the victory nine times out of ten. Those who\nprofess to be followers of Christ, and claim by their faith to be\nenlisted in the warfare against all evil in their nature, frequently\nplunge without thought into temptations from which it would require\na miracle to bring them forthunsullied. Meditation andprayerwould\nhave preserved them and led them to shun the critical, dangerous\nposition in which they placed themselves when they gave Satan the\nadvantage over them. The promises of God are not for us rashly to\nclaim while we rush on recklessly into danger, violating the laws of\nnature and disregarding prudence and the judgment with which God\nhas endowed us. This is the most flagrant presumption.\nThe thrones and kingdoms of the world and the glory of them\nwere offered to Christ if He would only bow down to Satan. Never\nwill man be tried with temptations as powerful as those which as-\nsailed Christ. Satan came with worldly honor, wealth, and the\nHeShowedUsHowtoOvercome,March7 151\npleasures of life, and presented them in the most attractive light to\nallure and deceive. “All these things,” said he to Christ, “will I give\nthee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.” Christ repelled the wily\nfoe and came off victor....\nChrist’s example is before us. He overcame Satan, showing us\nhow we may also overcome. Christ resisted Satan with Scripture.\nHe might have had recourse to His own divine power, and used His\nown words; but He said: “It is written”.... If the Sacred Scriptures\nwere studied and followed, the Christian would be fortified to meet\nthe wily foe....\nWhen the religion of Christ rules in the heart, conscience ap-\nproves, and peace and happiness reign; perplexity and trouble may\nsurround, yet there is light in the soul. Submission, love, and grati-\ntude to God keep sunshine in the heart, though the day maybe ever\nso cloudy (Testimonies For The Church 4:44-47)."

Could this man, who bore\nthe marks of toil and poverty, be the Messiah? Yet Nathanael could\nnot decide to reject Jesus, for the message of John had brought\nconviction to his heart.\nAt the time when Philip called him, Nathanael had withdrawn\nto a quiet grove to meditate upon the announcement of John and\nthe prophecies concerning the Messiah. He prayed that if the one\nannounced by John was the deliverer, it might be made known to\nhim, and the Holy Spirit rested upon him with assurance that God\nhad visited His people and raised up a horn of salvation for them....\nThe message, “We have found him, of whom Moses in the law,\nand the prophets, did write,” seemed to Nathanael a direct answer to\nhis prayer. But Philip had yet a trembling faith. He added doubtfully,\n“Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” Again prejudice arose in\nNathanael’s heart. He exclaimed, “Can there any good thing come\nout of Nazareth?”\nPhilip entered into no controversy. He said, “Come and see.”\n“Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold\nan Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!” In surprise Nathanael\nexclaimed, “Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said\nunto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the\nfig tree, I saw thee.”\nIt was enough. The divine Spirit that had borne witness to\nNathanael in his solitary prayer under the fig tree now spoke to\nhim in the words of Jesus. Though in doubt, and yielding somewhat\nto prejudice, Nathanael had come to Christ with an honest desire for\ntruth, and now his desire was met. His faith went beyond that of the\nWeHaveFoundtheMessias,March8 153\none who had brought him to Jesus. He answered and said, “Rabbi,\nThou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.”\nIf Nathanael had trusted to the rabbis for guidance, he would\nnever have found Jesus. It was by seeing and judging for himself\nthat he became a disciple. So in the case of many today whom\nprejudice withholds from good. How different would be the result if\nthey would “come and see”!\nWhile they trust to the guidance of human authority, none will\ncome to a saving knowledge of the truth. Like Nathanael, we need\nto study God’s Word for ourselves, and pray for the enlightenment\nof the Holy Spirit. He who saw Nathanael under the fig tree will see\nus in the secret place of prayer. Angels from the world of light are\nnear to those who in humility seek for divine guidance (The Desire\nof Ages, 139-141)."

For in every doctrine of grace, every promise of joy,\nevery deed of love, every divine attraction presented in the Saviour’s\nlife on earth, we see “God with us.”\nSatan represents God’s law of love as a law of selfishness.

Mark 12:43, RSV.\nJesus was in the court where were the treasure chests, and He\nwatched those who came to deposit their gifts. Many of the rich\nbrought large sums, which they presented with great ostentation.\nJesus looked upon them sadly, but made no comment on their liberal\nofferings. PresentlyHiscountenancelightedasHesawapoorwidow\napproach hesitatingly, as though fearful of being observed. As the\nrich and haughty swept by, to deposit their offerings, she shrank\nback as if hardly daring to venture farther. And yet she longed to do\nsomething, little though it might be, for the cause she loved.\nShe looked at the gift in her hand. It was very small in compari-\nson with the gifts of those around her, yet it was her all. Watching\nher opportunity, she hurriedly threw in her two mites, and turned to\nhasten away. But in doing this she caught the eye of Jesus, which\nwas fastened earnestly upon her.\nThe Saviour called His disciples to Him, and bade them mark\nthe widow’s poverty. Then His words of commendation fell upon\nher ear: “Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast\nin more than they all.” Tears of joy filled her eyes as she felt that\nher act was understood and appreciated. Many would have advised\nher to keep her pittance for her own use; given into the hands of the\nwell-fed priests, it would be lost sight of among the many costly\ngifts brought to the treasury. But Jesus understood her motive. She\nbelieved the service of the Temple to be of God’s appointment, and\nshe was anxious to do her utmost to sustain it. She did what she\ncould, and her act was to be a monument to her memory through all\ntime, and her joy in eternity. Her heart went with her gift; its value\nwas estimated, not by the worth of the coin, but by the love to God\nand the interest in His work that had prompted the deed....\nHeUnderstandsOurMotives,March15 167\nIt is the motive that gives character to our acts, stamping them\nwith ignominy or with high moral worth. Not the great things which\nevery eye sees and every tongue praises does God account most\nprecious. The little duties cheerfully done, the little gifts which\nmake no show, and which to human eyes may appear worthless,\noften stand highest in His sight. A heart of faith and love is dearer\nto God than the most costly gift.... It was this unselfish spirit and\nchildlike faith that won the Saviour’s commendation.\nAmong the poor there are many who long to show their gratitude\nto God for His grace and truth.... Let them lay up their mites in the\nbank of heaven. If given from a heart filled with love for God, these\nseeming trifles become consecrated gifts, priceless offerings, which\nGod smiles upon and blesses (The Desire of Ages, 614, 615)."

Bearing their burden of suffering, they seek\nthe Saviour. As they are crowded back by the surging throng, Christ\nmakes His way to them step by step, until He is close by their side.\nHope springs up in their hearts. Their tears of gladness fall as they\ncatch His attention, and look into the eyes expressing such pity and\nlove.\nSingling out one of the group, the Saviour invites her confidence,\nsaying, “What shall I do for thee?” She sobs out her great want,\n“Master, that thou wouldest heal my child.” Christ takes the little\none from her arms, and disease flees at His touch. The pallor of\ndeath is gone; the life-giving current flows through the veins; the\nmuscles receive strength. Words of comfort and peace are spoken\nto the mother; and then another case, just as urgent, is presented.\nAgain Christ exercises His life-giving power, and all give praise and\nhonor to Him who doeth wonderful things.\nWe dwell much on the greatness of Christ’s life. We speak of\nthe wonderful things that He accomplished, of the miracles that He\nwrought. But His attention to things accounted small is even higher\nproof of His greatness.\nAmong the Jews it was customary for children to be brought\nto some rabbi, that he might lay his hands upon them in blessing;\nbut the disciples thought the Saviour’s work too important to be\ninterrupted in this way. When the mothers came desiring Him to\nbless their little ones, the disciples looked on them with disfavor.\nThey thought these children too young to be benefited by a visit to\nHisCompassion,March16 169\nJesus, and concluded that He would be displeased at their presence.\nBut the Saviour understood the care and burden of the mothers who\nwere seeking to train their children according to the Word of God.\nHe had heard their prayers. He Himself had drawn them into His\npresence....\nChrist is today the same compassionate Saviour as when He\nwalked among men. He is as verily the helper of mothers now as\nwhen He gathered the little ones to His arms in Judea. The children\nof our hearths are as much a purchase of His blood as were the\nchildren of long ago....\nLet mothers come to Jesus with their perplexities. They will\nfind grace sufficient to aid them in the care of their children. The\ngates are open for every mother who would lay her burdens at the\nSaviour’s feet. He who said, “Suffer the little children to come unto\nme, and forbid them not” (Mark 10:14), still invites mothers to bring\ntheir little ones to be blessed by Him (The Ministry of Healing,\n38-42)."

He allowed the\ncrowd to press round Him, and complained not, though sometimes\nalmost lifted off His feet. When He met a funeral, He did not pass\nby indifferently. Sadness came over His face as He looked upon\ndeath, and He wept with the mourners.\nAs the children gathered the wildflowers growing so abundantly\naround them, and crowded up to present to Him their little offerings,\nHe received them gladly, smiled upon them, and expressed His joy\nat seeing so many varieties of flowers.\nThese children were His heritage. He knew that He had come to\nransom them from the enemy by dying on the cross of Calvary. He\nspoke words to them that ever after they carried in their hearts. They\nwere delighted to think that He appreciated their gifts and spoke so\nlovingly to them.\nChrist watched children at their play, and often expressed His\napproval when they gained an innocent victory over something they\nwere determined to do. He sang to children in sweet and blessed\nwords. They knew that He loved them. He never frowned on them.\nHe shared childish joys and sorrows. Often He would gather flowers,\nand after pointing out their beauties to the children, would leave\nthem with them as a gift. He had made the flowers, and He delighted\nto point out their beauties.\nIt has been said that Jesus never smiled. This is not correct. A\nchild in its innocence and purity called forth from His lips joyous\nsong.\nSympathytoAll,March17 171\nTo those who followed Him He explained the Word of God so\nclearly that they loved to be in His company. He led their minds\nfrom the inferior things of earth to the holy principles of truth and\nrighteousness. He prepared them to understand what is compre-\nhended in transformation of character after the divine similitude.\nHis words encouraged faith.

He imparted earthly blessings, that He might incline the\nhearts of men to receive the gospel of His grace.\nChrist might have occupied the highest place among the teachers\nof the Jewish nation, but He preferred rather to take the gospel to\nthe poor. He went from place to place, that those in the highways\nand byways might hear the words of truth. By the sea, on the\nmountainside, in the streets of the city, in the synagogue, His voice\nwas heard explaining the Scriptures. Often He taught in the outer\ncourt of the Temple, that the Gentiles might hear His words.\nSo unlike the explanations of Scripture given by the scribes and\nPharisees was Christ’s teaching, that the attention of the people was\narrested. The rabbis dwelt upon tradition, upon human theory and\nspeculation. Often that which men had taught and written about the\nScripture was put in place of the Scripture itself. The subject of\nChrist’s teaching was the Word of God. He met questioners with\na plain, “It is written,” “What saith the Scripture?” “How readest\nthou?” At every opportunity, when an interest was awakened by\neither friend or foe, He presented the Word. With clearness and\npower He proclaimed the gospel message. His words shed a flood of\nlight on the teachings of patriarchs and prophets, and the Scriptures\ncame to men as a new revelation. Never before had His hearers\nperceived in the Word of God such depth of meaning.\nNeverwastheresuchanevangelistasChrist.

His fame as the great Healer spread throughout Palestine.\nThe sick came to the places through which He would pass, that they\nAlwaysPresentingtheWordofGod,March19 175\nmight call on Him for help. Hither, too, came many anxious to hear\nHis words and to receive a touch of His hand. Thus He went from\ncity to city, from town to town, preaching the gospel and healing the\nsick—the King of glory in the lowly garb of humanity.\nHe attended the great yearly festivals of the nation, and to the\nmultitude absorbed in outward ceremony He spoke of heavenly\nthings,bringingeternitywithintheirview.

He laid aside His royal robe\nand kingly crown, and stepped down from His high command in\nthe heavenly courts. Clothing His divinity with humanity, Christ\nencircled the race with His long human arm. He stands at the head\nof humanity, not as a sinner but as a Saviour. It is because there is\nno spot or stain of sin upon His divine soul that He can stand there\nas the sinner’s surety. Because He is sinless He can take away our\nsins and place us on vantage ground with God, if we will believe\nin Him and trust Him as the One that will be our sanctification and\nrighteousness....\nHe has promised that if you ask wisdom from Him, He will give\nit to you. But it is not always essential for us to know all the whys\nand wherefores. We dishonor God by striving to get someone who\nwe think understands our case to help us. Has He not given us His\nonly begotten Son?

Jesus was the Prince of\nPeace. He came into the world to bring resistance and authority into\nsubjection to Himself.

It is our privilege to rest in His love, to say, “I will\ntrust Him; for He gave His life for me.” Human love may change,\nbut Christ’s love knows no change. When we cry to Him for help,\nHis hand is stretched out to save (The Ministry of Healing, 71, 72)."

We eat Christ’s flesh and drink His blood when by faith we\nlay hold upon Him as our Saviour.\nChrist used the figure of eating and drinking to represent that\nnearness to Him which all must have who are at last partakers with\nHim in His glory.

One wise man rejects one\nportion; another questions another part. They set up their judgment\nas superior to the Word; and the Scripture which they do teach rests\nupon their own authority. Its divine authenticity is destroyed. Thus\nthe seeds of infidelity are sown broadcast; for the people become\nconfused and know not what to believe.\nThere are many beliefs that the mind has no right to entertain. In\nthe days of Christ the rabbis put a forced, mystical construction upon\nmany portions of Scripture. Because the plain teaching of God’s\nWord condemned their practices, they tried to destroy its force. The\nsame thing is done today. The Word of God is made to appear\nmysterious and obscure in order to excuse transgression of His law.\nChrist rebuked these practices in His day. He taught that the Word\nof God was to be understood by all. He pointed to the Scriptures as\nof unquestionable authority, and we should do the same. The Bible\nis to be presented as the word of the infinite God, as the end of all\ncontroversy and the foundation of all faith.\nJesusSowedtheSeedoftheLivingWord,April4 209\nThe Bible has been robbed of its power, and the results are seen\nin a lowering of the tone of spiritual life.... [Yet] there are many who\nare crying out for the living God, longing for the divine presence....\nChrist’s favorite theme was the paternal tenderness and abundant\ngrace of God; He dwelt much upon the holiness of His character\nand His law; He presented Himself to the people as the Way, the\nTruth, and the Life. Let these be the themes of Christ’s ministers.\nPresent the truth as it is in Jesus. Make plain the requirements of\nthe law and the gospel. Tell the people of Christ’s life of self-denial\nand sacrifice; of His humiliation and death; of His resurrection and\nascension; of His intercession for them in the courts of God; of His\npromise, “I will come again, and receive you unto myself” (John\n14:3) (Christ’s Object Lessons, 39, 40)."

Says the apostle John, “Believe not every spirit, but try the\nspirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are\ngone out into the world” (1 John 4:1). And Isaiah declares, “To the\nGloryofaDivinePower,April14 229\nlaw and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it\nis because there is no light in them” (Isaiah 8:20)....\nIn harmony with the Word of God, His Spirit was to continue its\nwork throughout the period of the gospel dispensation. During the\nages while the Scriptures of both the Old and the New Testament\nwere being given, the Holy Spirit did not cease to communicate light\nto individual minds, apart from the revelations to be embodied in\nthe Sacred Canon. The Bible itself relates how, through the Holy\nSpirit, men received warning, reproof, counsel, and instruction, in\nmatters in no way relating to the giving of the Scriptures. And\nmention is made of prophets in different ages, of whose utterances\nnothing is recorded. In like manner, after the close of the canon\nof the Scriptures, the Holy Spirit was still to continue its work,\nto enlighten, warn, and comfort the children of God (The Great\nControversy, vi-viii)."

The accumulation of things\nthat minister to lust and ambition has brought upon the world the\njudgment of heaven.\nWhen in difficulty, philosophers and men of science try to satisfy\ntheir minds without appealing to God.

Questions relating to creation and providence they attempt\nto solve by saying, This is a law of nature.\nDisobedience has closed the door to a vast amount of knowledge\nthat might have been gained from the Word of God.

The mys-\ntery of redemption, the incarnation of Christ, His atoning sacrifice,\nwould not be vague in our minds. They would be not only better\nunderstood, but altogether more highly appreciated.\nA failure to study God’s Word is the great cause of mental weak-\nness and inefficiency. In turning from this Word to feed on the\nwritings of uninspired men, the mind becomes dwarfed and cheap-\nened. It is not brought in contact with deep, broad principles of\neternal truth. The understanding adapts itself to the comprehension\nof the things with which it is familiar, and in this devotion to finite\nthings it is weakened, its power is contracted, and after a time it\nbecomes unable to expand.\nKnowledgeoftheLord,April15 231\nAll this is false education. The work of every teacher should be\nto fasten the minds of the youth upon the grand truths of the Word\nof Inspiration. This is the education essential for this life and the\nlife to come.\nAnd let it not be thought that this will prevent the study of the\nsciences or cause a lower standard in education.

And\nthese principles may be understood by all....\nAnd even greater is the power of the Bible in the development\nof the spiritual nature. Man, created for fellowship with God, can\nonly in such fellowship find his real life and development. Created\nto find in God his highest joy, he can find in nothing else that which\ncan quiet the cravings of the heart, can satisfy the hunger and thirst\nof the soul. He who with sincere and teachable spirit studies God’s\nWord, seeking to comprehend its truths, will be brought in touch\nwith its Author; and, except by his own choice, there is no limit to\nthe possibilities of his development.\nIn its wide range of style and subjects the Bible has something to\ninterest every mind and appeal to every heart. In its pages are found\nhistory the most ancient; biography the truest to life; principles of\ngovernment for the control of the state, for the regulation of the\nhousehold—principles that human wisdom has never equaled. It\ncontains philosophy the most profound, poetry the sweetest and the\nmost sublime, the most impassioned and the most pathetic. Immea-\nsurably superior in value to the productions of any human author\nare the Bible writings, even when thus considered; but of infinitely\nwider scope, of infinitely greater value, are they when viewed in\ntheir relation to the grand central thought. Viewed in the light of\nthis thought, every topic has a new significance. In the most simply\nForThisLifeandtheLifetoCome,April18 237\nstated truths are involved principles that are as high as heaven and\nthat compass eternity.\nThe central theme of the Bible, the theme about which every\nother in the whole book clusters, is the redemption plan, the restora-\ntion in the human soul of the image of God. From the first intimation\nof hope in the sentence pronounced in Eden to that last glorious\npromise of the Revelation, “They shall see his face; and his name\nshall be in their foreheads” (Revelation 22:4), the burden of every\nbook and every passage of the Bible is the unfolding of this won-\ndrous theme—man’s uplifting—the power of God, “which giveth us\nthe victory through our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Corinthians 15:57).\nHe who grasps this thought has before him an infinite field for\nstudy. He has the key that will unlock to him the whole treasure\nhouse of God’s Word (Education, 123-126)."

The result of the\ninternal operation of the Holy Spirit is demonstrated in the outward\nconduct. The life of the Christian is hid with Christ in God, and God\nacknowledges those who are His, declaring, “Ye are My witnesses.”\nThey testify that divine power is influencing their hearts and shaping\ntheir conduct.

In\nTimothy, Paul saw one who appreciated the sacredness of the work\nof a minister; who was not appalled at the prospect of suffering and\npersecution; and who was willing to be taught. Yet the apostle did\nnot venture to take the responsibility of giving Timothy, an untried\nyouth, a training in the gospel ministry, without first fully satisfying\nhimself in regard to his character and his past life.\nTimothy’s father was a Greek and his mother a Jewess. From\na child he had known the Scriptures. The piety that he saw in his\nhome life was sound and sensible. The faith of his mother and his\ngrandmother in the sacred oracles was to him a constant reminder of\nthe blessing in doing God’s will. The Word of God was the rule by\nwhich these two godly women had guided Timothy. The spiritual\npower of the lessons that he had received from them kept him pure\nin speech and unsullied by the evil influences with which he was\nsurrounded. Thus his home instructors had cooperated with God in\npreparing him to bear burdens.\nPaul saw that Timothy was faithful, steadfast, and true, and he\nchose him as a companion in labor and travel. Those who had taught\nTimothy in his childhood were rewarded by seeing the son of their\ncare linked in close fellowship with the great apostle. Timothy was\na mere youth when he was chosen by God to be a teacher, but his\nprinciples had been so established by his early education that he was\nfitted to take his place as Paul’s helper.

In these private\ninterviews He unfolded to His hearers that which He did not attempt\nto tell to the mixed multitude. He needed not to speak to His friends\nin parables.\nAs Christ gave His wonderful lessons, Mary sat at His feet, a\nreverent and devoted listener.

The ark of\nGod’s testament is in the Holy of Holies, the second apartment of the\nsanctuary. In the ministration of the earthly tabernacle, which served\n“unto the example and shadow of heavenly things,” this apartment\nwas opened only upon the great Day of Atonement for the cleansing\nofthe sanctuary.

Then you will know that I am the Lord your God.\nEzekiel 20:19, 20, NIV.\nAt the time of the Exodus from Egypt, the Sabbath institution\nwas brought prominently before the people of God. While they were\nstill in bondage, their taskmasters had attempted to force them to\nlaboron the Sabbath by increasing the amount of work required each\nweek.... But the Israelites were delivered from bondage and brought\nto a place where they might observe unmolested all the precepts of\nJehovah.\nAt Sinai the law was spoken; and a copy of it, on two tables\nof stone, “written with the finger of God,” was delivered to Moses\n(Exodus 31:18). And through nearly forty years of wandering the\nIsraelites were constantly reminded of God’s appointed rest day, by\nthe withholding of the manna every seventh day and the miraculous\npreservation of the double portion that fell on the preparation day.\nBefore entering the Promised Land, the Israelites were admon-\nished by Moses to “keep the sabbath day to sanctify it” (Deuteron-\nomy 5:12). The Lord designed that by a faithful observance of the\nSabbath command, Israel should continually be reminded of their\naccountability to Him as their Creator and their Redeemer. While\nthey should keep the Sabbath in the proper spirit, idolatry could not\nexist; but should the claims of this precept of the Decalogue be set\naside as no longer binding, the Creator would be forgotten and men\nwould worship other gods.\n“I gave them my sabbaths,” God declared, “to be a sign between\nme and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify\nthem.” Yet “they despised my judgments, and walked not in my\nstatutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their\nidols.” And in His appeal to them to return to Him, He called their\nKeepingtheSabbath,May3 269\nattention anew to the importance of keeping the Sabbath holy. “I\nam the Lord your God,” He said; “walk in my statutes, and keep my\njudgments, and do them; and hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be\na sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord\nyour God” (Ezekiel 20:12, 16, 19, 20)....\nChrist, during His earthly ministry, emphasized the binding\nclaims of the Sabbath; in all His teaching He showed reverence\nfor the institution He Himself had given. In His days the Sabbath\nhad become so perverted that its observance reflected the character\nof selfish and arbitrary men rather than the character of God. Christ\nset aside the false teaching by which those who claimed to know\nGod had misrepresented Him. Although followed with merciless\nhostility by the rabbis, He did not even appear to conform to their re-\nquirements, butwentstraightforwardkeeping the Sabbathaccording\nto the law of God (Prophets and Kings, 180-183)."

        "content": "In the beginning, God gave His law to mankind as a means of\nattaining happiness and eternal life. Satan’s only hope of thwarting\nthe purpose of God is to lead men and women to disobey this law,\nand his constant effort has been to misrepresent its teachings and\nbelittle its importance. His master stroke has been an attempt to\nchange the law itself, so as to lead men to violate its precepts while\nprofessing to obey it.\nOne writer has likened the attempt to change the law of God to\nan ancient mischievous practice of turning in a wrong direction a\nsignpost erected at an important junction where two roads met. The\nperplexity and hardship which this practice often caused was great.\nA signpost was erected by God for those journeying through this\nworld. One arm of this signpost pointed out willing obedience to the\nCreator as the road to felicity and life, while the other arm indicated\ndisobedience as the path to misery and death. The way to happiness\nwas as clearly defined as was the way to the city of refuge under\nthe Jewish dispensation. But in an evil hour for our race, the great\nenemy of all good turned the signpost around, and multitudes have\nmistaken the way.\nThrough Moses the Lord instructed the Israelites: “Verily my\nsabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you through-\nout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that\ndoth sanctify you. Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy\nunto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for\nwhosoever doeth any work ... in the sabbath day, he shall surely be\nput to death. Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath,\nto observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual\ncovenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever:\nLawforMan’sHappiness,May6 275\nfor in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh\nday he rested, and was refreshed” (Exodus 31:13-17).\nIn these words the Lord clearly defined obedience as the way\nto the City of God; but the man of sin has changed the signpost,\nmaking it point in a wrong direction. He has set up a false sabbath\nand has caused men and women to think that by resting on it they\nwere obeying the command of the Creator.\nGod has declared that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord.\nWhen “the heavens and the earth were finished,” He exalted this\nday as a memorial of His creative work. Resting on the seventh\nday “from all his work which he had made, ... God blessed the\nseventh day, and sanctified it” (Genesis 2:1-3) (Prophets and Kings,\n178-180)."

Thus I will show the world that the day\nsanctified and blessed by God has been changed. That day shall not\nlive in the minds of the people. I will obliterate the memory of it.\nI will place in its stead a day that does not bear the credentials of\nGod, a day that cannot be a sign between God and His people. I will\nlead those who accept this day to place upon it the sanctity that God\nplaced upon the seventh day”....\nThrough the setting up of a false sabbath, the enemy thought to\nchange times and laws. But has he really succeeded in changing\nGod’s law? The words of the thirty-first chapter of Exodus are\nthe answer. He who is the same yesterday, today, and forever has\ndeclared of the seventh-day Sabbath: “It is a sign between me and\nyou throughout your generations.” “It is a sign ... for ever” (Exodus\n31:13, 17). The changed signpost is pointing the wrong way, but\nGod has not changed. He is still the mighty God of Israel. “Behold,\nthe nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small\ndust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little\nthing” (Isaiah 40:15).... And He is just as jealous for His law now as\nHe was in the days of Ahab and Elijah.\nBut how is that law disregarded! Behold the world today in open\nrebellion against God. This is in truth a froward generation, filled\nwith ingratitude, formalism, insincerity, pride, and apostasy. Men\nneglect the Bible and hate truth. Jesus sees His law rejected, His\nGod’sLawNeverChanges,May7 277\nlove despised, his ambassadors treated with indifference. He has\nspoken by His mercies, but these have been unacknowledged; He\nhas spoken by warnings, but these have been unheeded. The temple\ncourts of the human soul have been turned into places of unholy\ntraffic. Selfishness, envy, pride, malice—all are cherished....\nThose who believe that word just as it reads are held up to\nridicule. There is a growing contempt for law and order, directly\ntraceable to a violation of the plain commands of Jehovah (Prophets\nand Kings, 183-185).\nJehovah engraved His ten commandments on tables of stone,\nthat all the inhabitants of the earth might understand His eternal, un-\nchangeable character (Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students,\n248)."

James 2:8, RSV.\nThe standard by which to measure character is the royal law.\nThe law is the sin detector. By the law is the knowledge of sin.\nBut the sinner is constantly being drawn to Jesus by the wonderful\nmanifestation of His love in that He humiliated Himself to die a\nshameful death upon the cross. What a study is this! Angels have\nstriven, earnestly longed, to look into this wonderful mystery. It\nis a study that can tax the highest human intelligence, that man,\nfallen, deceived by Satan, taking Satan’s side of the question, can\nbe conformed to the image of the Son of the infinite God—that man\nshall be like Him, that, because of the righteousness of Christ given\nto man, God will love man, fallen but redeemed, even as He loved\nHis Son. Read it right out of the living oracles.\nThis is the mystery of godliness. This picture is of the highest\nvalue. It is to be meditated upon, placed in every discourse, hung in\nmemory’s hall, uttered by human lips, and traced by human beings\nwho have tasted and known that the Lord is good. It is to be the\ngroundwork of every discourse....\nA Christian is the highest type of a man because he is Christ-\nlike.... He feels his weakness, he lays hold with earnest purpose and\nliving faith upon the strength of God, and is an overcomer. Great\nbecomes his peace, his joy, for it comes from the Lord, and there is\nnothing more acceptable in the sight of God than the continual hu-\nmiliation of the soul before Him. These evidences are unmistakable\nproofs that the Lord has touched hearts by His Holy Spirit. More\nwonderful than miracles of physical healing is the miracle wrought\nin the child of God in wrestling with natural defects and overcoming\nthem. The universe of God looks upon him with joy far greater than\non any splendid outward display. The inward character is molded\nafter the divine Pattern....\nRoyalLawMeasuresCharacter,May16 295\nHolding up Christ as our only source of strength, presenting\nHis matchless love in having the guilt of the sins of men charged\nto His account and His own righteousness imputed to man, in no\ncase does away with the law or detracts from its dignity. Rather, it\nplaces it where the correct light shines upon and glorifies it. This is\ndone only through the light reflected from the cross of Calvary. The\nlaw is complete and full in the great plan of salvation, only as it is\npresented in the light shining from the crucified and risen Saviour.\nThis can be only spiritually discerned. It kindles in the heart of the\nbeholder ardent faith, hope, and joy that Christ is his righteousness.\nThis joy is only for those who love and keep the words of Jesus,\nwhich are the words of God (Manuscript 24, 1888)."

If he restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed,\nconfess his sins, and love God and his fellowmen, the sinner may be\nsure that he has passed from death unto life.\nWhen, as erring, sinful beings, we come to Christ and become\npartakers of His pardoning grace, love springs up in the heart. Every\nburden is light, for the yoke that Christ imposes is easy. Duty\nbecomes a delight, and sacrifice a pleasure. The path that before\nseemed shrouded in darkness, becomes bright with beams from the\nSun of Righteousness.\nThe loveliness of the character of Christ will be seen in His\nfollowers. It was His delight to do the will of God. Love to God,\nzeal for His glory, was the controlling power in our Saviour’s life.\nLove beautified and ennobled all His actions. Love is of God. The\nunconsecrated heart cannot originate or produce it. It is found only\nin the heart where Jesus reigns. “We love, because he first loved\nus” (1 John 4:19, RV). In the heart renewed by divine grace, love\nis the principle of action. It modifies the character, governs the\nimpulses, controls the passions, subdues enmity, and ennobles the\naffections. This love, cherished in the soul, sweetens the life and\nsheds a refining influence on all around.\nThere are two errors against which the children of God—partic-\nularly those who have just come to trust in His grace—especially\nneed to guard. The first ... is that of looking to their own works,\ntrusting to anything they can do, to bring themselves into harmony\nwith God. He who is trying to become holy by his own works in\nkeeping the law, is attempting an impossibility. All that man can do\nwithout Christ is polluted with selfishness and sin. It is the grace of\nChrist alone, through faith, that can make us holy.\nPrincipleofLoveintheLaw,May17 297\nThe opposite and no less dangerous error is that belief in Christ\nreleases men from keeping the law of God; that since by faith alone\nwe become partakers of the grace of Christ, our works have nothing\nto do with our redemption.\nButnotice here thatobedience is nota mere outwardcompliance,\nbut the service of love. The law of God is an expression of His very\nnature; it is an embodiment of the great principle of love, and hence\nisthefoundationofHisgovernmentinheavenandearth. Ifourhearts\nare renewed in the likeness of God, if the divine love is implanted\nin the soul, will not the law of God be carried out in the life? When\nthe principle of love is implanted in the heart, when man is renewed\nafter the image of Him that created him, the new covenant promise\nis fulfilled.... Obedience—the service and allegiance of love—is the\ntrue sign of discipleship (Steps to Christ, 59, 60)."

        "content": "Among the Jews the question “Who is my neighbor?” caused\nendless dispute. They had no doubt as to the heathen and the Samar-\nitans. These were strangers and enemies. But where should the\ndistinction be made among the people of their own nation, and\namong the different classes of society? Whom should the priest, the\nrabbi, the elder, regard as neighbor? ...\nThis question Christ answered in the parable of the good Samar-\nitan. He showed that our neighbor does not mean merely one of\nthe church or faith to which we belong. It has no reference to race,\ncolor, or class distinction. Our neighbor is every person who needs\nour help. Our neighbor is every soul who is wounded and bruised by\nthe adversary. Our neighbor is everyone who is the property of God.\nThe parable of the good Samaritan was called forth by a question\nput to Christ by a doctor of the law. As the Saviour was teaching,\n“a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what\nshall I do to inherit eternal life?” The Pharisees had suggested this\nquestion to the lawyer, in the hope that they might entrap Christ\nin His words, and they listened eagerly for His answer. But the\nSaviourenteredintonocontroversy.

He had been studying the Scriptures with a desire to learn\ntheir real meaning. He had a vital interest in the matter, and he asked\nin sincerity, “What shall I do?” In his answer as to the requirements\nof the law, he passed by all the mass of ceremonial and ritualistic\nWhatisWrittenintheLaw? May20 303\nprecepts. For these he claimed no value, but presented the two great\nprinciples on which hang all the law and the prophets. The Saviour’s\ncommendation of this answer placed Him on vantage ground with\nthe rabbis. They could not condemn Him for sanctioning that which\nhad been advanced by an expositor of the law.\n“This do, and thou shalt live,” Christ said. In His teaching He\never presented the law as a divine unity, showing that it is impossible\nto keep one precept and break another; for the same principle runs\nthrough all. Man’s destiny will be determined by his obedience to\nthe whole law (Christ’s Object Lessons, 376-378)."

Onlybyacceptingthevirtueandgraceof\nChrist can we keep the law. Belief in the propitiation for sin enables\nfallen man to love God with his whole heart and his neighbor as\nhimself.\nThe lawyer knew that he had kept neither the first four nor the\nlast six commandments. He was convicted under Christ’s searching\nwords, but instead of confessing his sin, he tried to excuse it. Rather\nthan acknowledge the truth, he endeavored to show how difficult\nof fulfillment the commandment is. Thus he hoped both to parry\nconviction and to vindicate himself in the eyes of the people. The\nSaviour’s words had shown that his question was needless, since he\nwas able to answer it himself. Yet he put another question, saying,\n“Who is my neighbour?”\nAgain Christ refused to be drawn into controversy. He answered\nthe question by relating an incident, the memory of which was fresh\nin the minds of His hearers. “A certain man,” He said, “went down\nfrom Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped\nhim of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him\nhalf dead”....\nAs he lay thus, a priest came that way; he saw the man lying\nwounded and bruised, weltering in his own blood; but he left him\nwithout rendering any assistance. He “passed by on the other side.”\nThen a Levite appeared. Curious to know what had happened, he\nstopped and looked at the sufferer. He was convicted of what he\nought to do, but it was not an agreeable duty. He wished that he had\nnot come that way so that he would not have seen the wounded man.\nInHarmonyWithGod’sLaw,May21 305\nHe persuaded himself that the case was no concern of his, and he\ntoo “passed by on the other side.”\nBut a Samaritan, traveling the same road, saw the sufferer, and\nhe did the work that others had refused to do. With gentleness and\nkindness he ministered to the wounded man. “When he saw him, he\nhad compassion on him, and went to him, and bound up his wounds,\npouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought\nhim to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow when he\ndeparted, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said\nunto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more,\nwhen I come again, I will repay thee.” The priest and the Levite\nboth professed piety, but the Samaritan showed that he was truly\nconverted. It was no more agreeable for him to do the work than for\nthe priest and the Levite, but in spirit and works he proved himself\nto be in harmony with God (Christ’s Object Lessons, 378-380)."

Deuteronomy 6:1, 2.\nIn this scripture we are taught that obedience to God’s require-\nments brings the obedient under the laws that control the physical\nbeing. Those who would preserve themselves in health must bring\ninto subjection all appetites and passions. They must not indulge\nlustful passion and intemperate appetite, for they are to remain under\ncontrol to God, and their physical, mental, and moral powers are to\nbe so wisely employed that the bodily mechanism will remain in\ngood working order.\nHealth, life, and happiness are the result of obedience to physical\nlaws governing our bodies. If our will and way are in accordance\nwithGod’swillandway; ifwedothepleasureofourCreator,Hewill\nkeep the human organism in good condition, and restore the moral,\nmental, and physical powers, in order that He may work through\nus to His glory. Constantly His restoring power is manifested in\nour bodies. If we cooperate with Him in this work, health and\nhappiness, peace and usefulness, are the sure results (The S.D.A.\nBible Commentary, Ellen G. White Comments 1:1118).\n“And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the\nLord our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive,\nas it is at this day. And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe\nto do all these commandments before the Lord our God, as he hath\ncommanded us.” The fear here spoken of it not a servile fear, but a\ngodly fear.\nGod gave these laws to Israel to preserve them in a happy, health-\nful state. If there had existed no Satan to tempt them, these special\nResultsofObediencetoPhysicalLaws,May26 315\ninstructions would not have been needed; but unless the people had\nsomething to guide them, they would surely be led astray by the\nspecious devisings of the enemy of all righteousness. Their only\nsafety was to be found in hearkening with all diligence to the word\nof the Lord.\nParents who desire to train their children aright should heed the\ninstruction given in these scriptures, and allow their little ones to do\nnothing in disregard of God’s commandments so plainly given. Let\nfathers and mothers faithfully teach their children these precepts,\nand impress upon their tender minds that fact that in obedience there\nis life, health, happiness....\nThe great object we should always keep in view, when obtaining\na knowledge of God’s laws, is that we are to become acquainted with\nHis will in order that we may obey Him (Manuscript 151, 1901)."

This truth, with others included in the message, is to be\nproclaimed; but the great center of attraction, Christ Jesus, must\nnot be left out. It is at the cross of Christ that mercy and truth\nmeet together, and righteousness and peace kiss each other. The\nsinner must be led to look to Calvary; with the simple faith of a\nlittle child he must trust in the merits of the Saviour, accepting His\nrighteousness, believing in His mercy.\nThrough the love of God the treasures of the grace of Christ have\nbeen laid open before the church and the world. “God so loved the\nworld, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth\nin him should not perish, but have everlasting life” (John 3:16).\nWhat marvelous, unfathomable love, which led Christ to die for us\nwhile we were yet sinners! And what a loss the soul suffers who,\nunderstanding the strong claims of the law, fails to acknowledge that\nwhere sin abounds, the grace of Christ does much more abound!\nWhen the law is presented as it should be, it reveals the love of\nGod.

Let all your powers be directed to pointing souls,\nconfused, bewildered, lost to “the Lamb of God.” Lift Him up, the\nrisen Saviour, and say to all who hear, Come to Him who “hath\nloved us, and hath given himself for us” (Ephesians 5:2). Let the\nscience of salvation be the burden of every sermon, the theme of\nevery song. Let it be poured forth in every supplication....

This robe of light was a symbol of their\nspiritual garments of heavenly innocence. Had they remained true\nto God, it would ever have continued to enshroud them. But when\nsin entered, they severed their connection with God, and the light\nthat had encircled them departed. Naked and ashamed, they tried to\nsupply the place of the heavenly garments by sewing together fig\nleaves for a covering.\nThis is what the transgressors of God’s law have done ever since\nthe day of Adam and Eve’s disobedience. They have sewed together\nfig leaves to cover the nakedness caused by transgression. They have\nworn the garments of their own devising, by works of their own they\nhave tried to cover their sins, and make themselves acceptable with\nGod.\nBut this they can never do. Nothing can man devise to supply the\nplace of his lost robe of innocence. No fig-leaf garments, no worldly\ncitizen dress, can be worn by those who sit down with Christ and\nangels at the marriage supper of the Lamb.\nOnly the covering which Christ Himself has provided can make\nus meet to appear in God’s presence. This covering, the robe of His\nown righteousness, Christ will put upon every repenting, believing\nsoul....\nThis robe, woven in the loom of heaven, has in it not one thread\nof human devising. Christ in His humanity wrought out a perfect\ncharacter, and this character He offers to impart to us. “All our\nRobeofChrist’sOwnRighteousness,May29 321\nrighteousnesses are as filthy rags.” Everything that we of ourselves\ncan do is defiled by sin. But the Son of God “was manifested to take\naway our sins; and in him is no sin”....\nBy His perfect obedience He has made it possible for every\nhuman being to obey God’s commandments. When we submit our-\nselves to Christ, the heart is united with His heart, the will is merged\nin His will, the mind becomes one with His mind, the thoughts\nare brought into captivity to Him; we live His life. This is what it\nmeans to be clothed with the garment of His righteousness. Then\nas the Lord looks upon us, He sees, not the fig-leaf garment, not the\nnakedness and deformity of sin, but His own robe of righteousness,\nwhich is perfect obedience to the law of Jehovah (Christ’s Object\nLessons, 310-312).\n[164] Transforming Power of Obedience to God’s Law,"

The compassion and tenderness\nthat he revealed toward those who had sinned, either willfully or\nthrough ignorance, should be an object lesson to all who seek to\nbring about reforms. The servants of God are to be as firm as a\nrock where right principles are involved; and yet, withal, they are\nto manifest sympathy and forbearance.

We are the living\nhuman agencies to represent in character Jesus Christ to the world.\nNot only did Christ give explicit rules showing how we may become\nobedient children, but He showed us in His own life and character\njust how to do those things which are right and acceptable with God,\nChristInvitesOurConfidence,June4 335\nso there is no excuse why we should not do those things which are\npleasing in His sight.\nWe are ever to be thankful that Jesus has proved to us by actual\nfacts that man can keep the commandments of God, giving contra-\ndiction to Satan’s falsehood that man cannot keep them. The Great\nTeacher came to our world to stand at the head of humanity, to thus\nelevate and sanctify humanity by His holy obedience to all of God’s\nrequirements showing it is possible to obey all the commandments\nof God. He has demonstrated that a lifelong obedience is possible.\nThus He gives men to the world, as the Father gave the Son, to\nexemplify in their life the life of Jesus Christ....\nJesus says, “Follow me” (Manuscript 1, 1892)."

In Christ’s name\nHis followers are to stand before God. Through the value of the sac-\nrifice made for them, they are of value in the Lord’s sight. Because\nof the imputed righteousness of Christ they are accounted precious.\nFor Christ’s sake the Lord pardons those that fear Him. He does not\nsee in them the vileness of the sinner. He recognizes in them the\nlikeness of His Son, in whom they believe.\nThe Lord is disappointed when His people place a low estimate\nuponthemselves. HedesiresHischosenheritagetovaluethemselves\naccording to the price He has placed upon them. God wanted them,\nelse He would not have sent His Son on such an expensive errand\nto redeem them. He has a use for them, and He is well pleased\nwhen they make the very highest demands upon Him, that they may\nglorify His name. They may expect larger things if they have faith\nin His promises.\nBut to pray in Christ’s name means much. It means that we are\nto accept His character, manifest His spirit, and work His works.\nThe Saviour’s promise is given on condition. “If ye love me,” He\nsays, “keep my commandments.” He saves men, not in sin, but from\nsin; and those who love Him will show their love by obedience.\nAll true obedience comes from the heart. It was heart work with\nChrist. And if we consent, He will so identify Himself with our\nthoughts and aims, so blend our hearts and minds into conformity to\nHis will, that when obeying Him we shall be but carrying out our\nown impulses. The will, refined and sanctified, will find its highest\ndelightindoingHisservice. WhenweknowGodasitisourprivilege\nto know Him, our life will be a life of continual obedience.

They obtained their\nknowledge by the faithful use of their powers, under the guidance\nof the Holy Spirit. They placed themselves in connection with the\nSource of all wisdom, making the knowledge of God the foundation\nof their education. In faith they prayed for wisdom, and they lived\ntheir prayers. They placed themselves where God could bless them.\nThey avoided that which would weaken their powers, and improved\nevery opportunity to become intelligent in all lines of learning. They\nfollowed the rules of life that could not fail to give them strength\nof intellect. They sought to acquire knowledge for one purpose—\nthat they might honor God. They realized that in order to stand as\nrepresentativesoftruereligionamidthefalsereligionsofheathenism\nthey must have clearness of intellect and must perfect a Christian\ncharacter. And God Himself was their teacher. Constantly praying,\nconscientiously studying, keeping in touch with the Unseen, they\nwalked with God as did Enoch.\nTrue success in any line of work is not the result of chance or\naccident or destiny. It is the outworking of God’s providences, the\nreward of faith and discretion, of virtue and perseverance. Fine\nmental qualities and a high moral tone are not the result of accident.\nGod gives opportunities; success depends upon the use made of\nthem.\nWhile God was working in Daniel and his companions “to will\nand to do of His good pleasure” (Philippians 2:13), they were work-\ning out their own salvation. Herein is revealed the outworking of\nthe divine principle of cooperation, without which no true success\ncan be attained. Human effort avails nothing without divine power;\nand without human endeavor, divine effort is with many of no avail.\nGodHimselfWasDaniel’sTeacher,June28 383\nTo make God’s grace our own, we must act our part. His grace is\ngiven to work in us to will and to do, but never as a substitute for\nour effort.\nAs the Lord cooperated with Daniel and his fellows, so He will\ncooperate with all who strive to do His will. And by the impartation\nof His Spirit He will strengthen every true purpose, every noble\nresolution. Those who walk in the path of obedience will encounter\nmany hindrances. Strong, subtle influences may bind them to the\nworld; but the Lord is able to render futile every agency that works\nforthe defeatofHis chosen ones; in His strengththey may overcome\nevery temptation, conquer every difficulty (Prophets and Kings, 486,\n487)."

They had not\nbeen students in the schools of the prophets, but for three years they\nhad been taught by the greatest Educator the world has ever known.\nUnder His instruction they had become elevated, intelligent, and\nrefined, agents through whom men might be led to a knowledge of\nthe truth....\nThe evening was pleasant, and Peter, who still had much of his\nold love for boats and fishing, proposed that they should go out upon\nthe sea and cast their nets. In this plan all were ready to join; they\nwereinneedoffoodandclothing, whichtheproceedsofasuccessful\nnight’s fishing would supply. So they went out in their boat, but\nthey caught nothing. All night they toiled, without success. Through\nthe weary hours they talked of their absent Lord, and recalled the\nwonderful events they had witnessed in His ministry beside the sea.\nThey questioned as to their own future, and grew sad at the prospect\nbefore them.\nAll the while a lone watcher upon the shore followed them with\nHis eye, while He Himself was unseen. At length the morning\ndawned. The boat was but a little way from the shore, and the\ndisciples saw a stranger standing upon the beach, who accosted\nthem with the question, “Children, have ye any meat?” When they\nanswered, “No,” He said unto them, “Cast the net on the right side\nof the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they\nwere not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.”\nTaughtbytheWorld’sGreatestEducator,June29 385\nJohn recognized the stranger, and exclaimed to Peter, “It is the\nLord”.... Jesus had called them to leave their fishing boats, and\nhad promised to make them fishers of men. It was to bring this\nscene to their minds, and to deepen its impression, that He had again\nperformed the miracle. His act was a renewal of the commission\nto the disciples. It showed them that the death of their Master had\nnot lessened their obligation to do the work He had assigned them.\nThough they were to be deprived of His personal companionship,\nand of the means of support by their former employment, the risen\nSaviour would still have a care for them. While they were doing His\nwork, He would provide for their needs. And Jesus had a purpose in\nbidding them cast their net on the right side of the ship. On that side\nHe stood upon the shore. That was the side of faith. If they labored\nin connection with Him—His divine power combining with their\nhuman effort—they could not fail of success (The Desire of Ages,\n809-811)."

As\nthe Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down\nmy life for the sheep” (John 10:11, 14, 15).\nAs an earthly shepherd knows his sheep, so does the divine\nShepherd know His flock that are scattered throughout the world.\n“Ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God,\nsaith the Lord God” (Ezekiel 34:31).\nIn the parable of the lost sheep, the shepherd goes out to search\nfor one sheep—the very least that can be numbered. Discovering\nthat one of his sheep is missing, he does not look carelessly upon\nthe flock that is safely housed, and say, I have ninety and nine, and it\nwill cost me too much trouble to go in search of the straying one. Let\nhim come back, and I will open the door of the sheepfold and let him\nin. No; no sooner does the sheep go astray than the shepherd is filled\nwith grief and anxiety. Leaving the ninety and nine in the fold, he\ngoes in search of the straying one. However dark and tempestuous\nthe night, however perilous and uncertain the way, however long and\ntedious the search, he does not falter until the lost is found.\nWith what relief does he hear in the distance its first faint cry!\nFollowing the sound, he climbs the steepest heights; he goes to\nthe very edge of the precipice, at the risk of his own life. Thus he\nsearches while the cry, growing fainter, tells him that his sheep is\nready to die.\nAnd when the straying one is found, does he command it to\nfollow him? ... No; he lays the exhausted sheep on his shoulder,\nand with cheerful gratitude that his search has not been in vain,\nhe returns to the fold. His gratitude finds expression in songs of\nGoodShepherd,July6 401\nrejoicing. And “when he cometh home, he calleth together his\nfriends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I\nhave found my sheep which was lost” (Luke 15:6).\nSo when the lost sinner is found by the Good Shepherd, heaven\nand earth unite in rejoicing and thanksgiving. For “joy shall be in\nheaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and\nnine just persons, which need no repentance” (verse 7) (Gospel\nWorkers, 181, 182).\nIn our work, individual effort will accomplish much more than\ncan be estimated. It is for the want of this that souls are perishing.\nOne soul is of infinite value; Calvary speaks its worth.

But the only door is Christ, and all who have\ninterposed something to take the place of Christ, all who have tried\nto enter the fold in some other way, are thieves and robbers....\n“He that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.”\nChrist is both the door and the shepherd. He enters in by Himself.\nIt is through His own sacrifice that He becomes the shepherd of the\nsheep (The Desire of Ages, 476-478)."

Anciently as now there was little security outside of the\nwalled towns.

The shepherd watched his charge, knowing that it was\nat the peril of his own life. Jacob, who kept the flocks of Laban in\nthe pasture grounds of Haran, describing his own unwearied labor,\nsaid, “In the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night;\nand my sleep departed from my eyes” (Genesis 31:40). And it was\nwhile guarding his father’s sheep that the boy David, single-handed,\nencountered the lion and the bear, and rescued from their teeth the\nstolen lamb.\nAs the shepherd leads his flock over the rocky hills, through\nforest and wild ravines, to grassy nooks by the riverside; as he\nwatches them on the mountains through the lonely night, shielding\nfrom robbers, caring tenderlyforthe sicklyandfeeble, his life comes\nto be one with theirs. A strong and tender attachment unites him to\nthe objects of his care. However large the flock, the shepherd knows\nevery sheep.

So does the Saviour-Shepherd with\nHis sheep. The Scripture says, “Thou leddest thy people like a\nflock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.” Through the prophet, Jesus\ndeclares, “I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with\nlovingkindness have I drawn thee.” He compels none to follow Him.\n“I drew them,” He says, “with cords of a man, with bands of love”\n(Psalm 77:20; Jeremiah 31:3; Hosea 11:4).\nItis notthe fearofpunishment, orthe hope ofeverlasting reward,\nthat leads the disciples of Christ to follow Him. They behold the\nSaviour’s matchless love, revealed throughout His pilgrimage on\nearth, from the manger of Bethlehem to Calvary’s cross, and the\nsight of Him attracts, it softens and subdues the soul. Love awakens\nin the heart of the beholders. They hear His voice, and they follow\nHim.\nAs the shepherd goes before his sheep, himself first encountering\nthe perils of the way, so does Jesus with His people. “When he\nputteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them.” The way to\nheaven is consecrated by the Saviour’s footprints. The path may\nbe steep and rugged, but Jesus has traveled that way; His feet have\npressed down the cruel thorns, to make the pathway easier for us.\nEvery burden that we are called to bear He Himself has borne.\nThough now He has ascended to the presence of God, and shares\nthe throne of the universe, Jesus has lost none of His compassionate\nnature. Today the same tender, sympathizing heart is open to all the\nwoes of humanity. Today the hand that was pierced is reached for\nto bless more abundantly His people that are in the world. “And\nShepherdLeadstheWay,July9 407\nthey shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my\nhand.”\nThe soul that has given himself to Christ is more precious in His\nsight than the whole world. The Saviour would have passed through\nthe agony of Calvary that one might be saved in His kingdom. He\nwill never abandon one for whom He has died. Unless His followers\nchoose to leave Him, He will hold them fast.\nThrough all of our trials we have a never-failing Helper. He does\nnot leave us alone to struggle with temptation, to battle with evil,\nand be finally crushed with burdens and sorrow. Though now He is\nhidden from mortal sight, the ear of faith can hear His voice saying,\n“Fear not; I am with you.” “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and,\nbehold, I am alive for evermore” (Revelation 1:18) (The Desire of\nAges, 480-483)."

The undershepherds know something of the stern conflict,\nbut little in comparison to what is endured by the Shepherd of the\nsheep. With what compassion, what sorrow, what persistence, He\nseeks the lost! How few realize what desperate efforts are put forth\nby Satan to defeat the Shepherd’s purpose. When the Shepherd at\nlast finds His lost sheep, He gathers it in His arms with rejoicing,\nand bears it back to the fold on His shoulders. And the harps of\nheaven are touched, and an anthem of rejoicing is sung over the\nransom of the wandering and lost sheep. “Joy shall be in heaven\nover one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just\npersons which need no repentance.”...\nThe Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost. A\nlost sheep never finds its way back to the fold of itself. If it is not\nsought for and saved by the watchful shepherd, it wanders until it\nperishes. What a representation of the Saviour is this! Unless Jesus,\nthe Good Shepherd, had come to seek and to save the wandering,\nwe should have perished. The Pharisees had taught that none but the\nJewish nation would be saved, and they treated all other nationalities\nwith contempt. But Jesus attracted the attention of those that the\nPharisees despised, and He treated them with consideration and\ncourtesy....\n“God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that\nwhosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting\nJoyOverOneSinnerthatRepenteth,July17 423\nlife.” This love on behalf of man, expressed in the gift of His only-\nbegotten Son, called forth from Satan the most intense hatred, both\ntowardtheGiverandtowardthepricelessGift.

The first work that Christ entrusted\nto Peter, on restoring him to the ministry, was to feedthe lambs. This\nwas a work in which Peter had had little experience. It would require\ngreat care and tenderness, much patience and perseverance. It called\nhim to minister to the children and youth, and to those young in the\nfaith, to teach the ignorant, to open the Scriptures to them, and to\neducate them for usefulness in Christ’s service. Heretofore Peter\nhad not been fitted to do this, or even to understand its importance.\nThe question that Christ put to Peter was significant. He men-\ntioned only one condition of discipleship and service. “Lovest thou\nme?” He said. This is the essential qualification. Though Peter\nmight possess every other, without the love of Christ he could not be\na faithful shepherd over the Lord’s flock. Knowledge, benevolence,\neloquence, gratitude, and zeal are all aids in the good work; but\nwithout the love of Jesus in the heart, the work of the Christian\nminister will prove a failure.\nThe lesson which Christ taught him by the Sea of Galilee, Peter\ncarried with him through his life. Writing by the Holy Spirit to the\nchurches, he said:\n“The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder,\nand a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the\nglory that shall be revealed: Feed the flock of God which is among\nyou, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly;\nnot for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over\nGod’s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. And when the\nChief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that\nfadeth not away” (1 Peter 5:1-4).\nUndershepherds,July28 445\nThe sheep that has strayed from the fold is the most helpless of\nall creatures. It must be sought for; for it cannot find its way back.\nSo with the soul that has wandered away from God; he is as helpless\nas the lost sheep; and unless divine love comes to his rescue, he\ncan never find his way to God. Then with what compassion, what\nsorrow, what persistence, should the undershepherd seek for lost\nsouls! ... This means the bearing of physical discomfort and the\nsacrifice of ease. It means a tender solicitude for the erring, a divine\ncompassion and forbearance. It means an ear that can listen with\nsympathy to heartbreaking recitals of wrong, of degradation, of\ndespair and misery.\nThe spirit of the true shepherd is one of self-forgetfulness.

Before the assembled disciples Jesus revealed the depth of\nPeter’s repentance, and showed how thoroughly humbled was the\nonce boasting disciple.\nPeter was naturally forward and impulsive, and Satan had taken\nadvantage of these characteristics to overthrow him. Just before the\nfall of Peter, Jesus had said to him, “Satan hath desired to have, that\nhe may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith\nfailnot: andwhen thou artconverted, strengthen thybrethren” (Luke\n22:31, 32). That time had now come, and the transformation in Peter\nwas evident. The close, testing questions of the Lord had not called\nout one forward, self-sufficient reply; and because of his humiliation\nand repentance, Peter was better prepared than ever before to act as\nshepherd to the flock....\nBefore his fall, Peter was always speaking unadvisedly, from the\nimpulse of the moment. He was always ready to correct others, and\nto express his mind, before he had a clear comprehension of himself\nor of what he had to say. But the converted Peter was very different.\nHe retained his former fervor, but the grace of Christ regulated his\nzeal. He was no longer impetuous, self-confident, and self-exalted,\nbut calm, self-possessed, and teachable. He could then feed the\nlambs as well as the sheep of Christ’s flock.\nThe Saviour’s manner of dealing with Peter had a lesson for\nhim and for his brethren. It taught them to meet the transgressor\nwith patience, sympathy, and forgiving love. Although Peter had\ndenied his Lord, the love which Jesus bore him never faltered. Just\nsuch love should the undershepherd feel for the sheep and lambs\ncommitted to his care. Remembering his own weakness and failure,\nConvertedPeter,anUndershepherd,July29 447\nPeter was to deal with his flock as tenderly as Christ had dealt with\nhim....\nJesus walked alone with Peter, for there was something which\nHe wished to communicate to him only. Before His death, Jesus\nhad said to him, “Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but\nthou shalt follow me afterwards.” To this Peter had replied, “Lord,\nwhy cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake”\n(John 13:36, 37).... Peter had failed when the test came, but again\nhe was to have opportunity to prove his love for Christ.... Jesus thus\nmade known to Peter the very manner of his death; He even foretold\nthe stretching forth of his hands upon the cross.... He felt willing to\nsuffer any death for his Lord (The Desire of Ages, 812-815)."

Says\nPaul: “Ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,\nAbba, Father”....\nWith the beloved John I call upon you to “behold, what manner\nof love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called\nthe sons of God.” What love, what matchless love, that, sinners and\naliens as we are, we may be brought back to God and adopted into\nHis family! We may address Him by the endearing name, “Our\nFather,” which is a sign of our affection for Him and a pledge of His\ntender regard and relationship to us. And the Son of God, beholding\nthe heirs of grace, “is not ashamed to call them brethren.” They have\neven a more sacred relationship to God than have the angels who\nhave never fallen.\nAll the paternal love which has come down from generation to\ngeneration through the channel of human hearts, all the springs of\ntenderness which have opened the souls of men, are but as a tiny rill\nto the boundless ocean when compared with the infinite, exhaustless\nlove of God. Tongue cannot utter it; pen cannot portray it. You\nmay meditate upon it every day of your life; you may search the\nScriptures diligently in order to understand it; you may summon\nevery power and capability that God has given you, in the endeavor\nto comprehend the love and compassion of the heavenly Father;\nand yet there is an infinity beyond. You may study that love for\nages; yet you can never fully comprehend the length and breadth,\nWhatMatchlessLove! August1 455\nthe depth and the height, of the love of God in giving His Son to\ndie for the world. Eternity itself can never fully reveal it. Yet as we\nstudy the Bible and meditate upon the life of Christ and the plan\nof redemption, these great themes will open to our understanding\nmore and more. And it will be ours to realize the blessing which\nPaul desired for the Ephesian church when he prayed “that the God\nof our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the\nspirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: the eyes\nof your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what\nis the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his\ninheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his\npower to us-ward who believe” (Ephesians 1:17-19) (Testimonies\nfor the Church 5:739, 740)."

As the mountains are\nround about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people\nfrom henceforth even for ever. Psalm 125:1, 2.\nIt was the cross, that instrument of shame and torture, which\nbrought hope and salvation to the world. The disciples were but\nhumble men, without wealth, and with no weapon but the word of\nGod; yet in Christ’s strength they went forth to tell the wonderful\nstory of the manger and the cross, and to triumph over all opposition.\nWithoutearthlyhonororrecognition,theywereheroesoffaith. From\ntheir lips came words of divine eloquence that shook the world.\nIn Jerusalem, where the deepest prejudice existed, and where\nthe most confused ideas prevailed in regard to Him who had been\ncrucified as a malefactor, the disciples continued to speak with bold-\nness the words of life, setting before the Jews the work and mission\nof Christ, His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Priests and\nrulersheardwithamazementtheclear,boldtestimonyoftheapostles.\nThe power of the risen Saviour had indeed fallen on the disciples,\nand their work was accompanied by signs and miracles that daily\nincreased the number of believers. Along the streets where the dis-\nciples were to pass, the people laid their sick “on beds and couches,\nthat at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow\nsome of them.” Here also were brought those vexed with unclean\nspirits. The crowds gathered round them, and those who were healed\nshouted the praises of God and glorified the name of the Redeemer....\nHitherto all the efforts made to suppress this new teaching had\nbeen in vain; but now both Sadducees and Pharisees determined\nthat the work of the disciples should be stopped, for it was proving\nthem guilty of the death of Jesus. Filled with indignation, the priests\nlaid violent hands on Peter and John, and put them in the common\nprison....\nHopeandSalvationtotheWorld,August2 457\nThe disciples were not intimidated or cast down by this treat-\nment.... The God of heaven, the mighty Ruler of the universe, took\nthe matter of the imprisonment of the disciples into His own hands....\nBy night the angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and said to\nthe disciples, “Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all\nthe words of this life” (Acts 5:20) (The Acts of the Apostles, 77-80).\nShortly before His crucifixion Christ had bequeathed to His\ndisciples a legacy of peace. “Peace I leave with you,” He said, “my\npeace I give unto you”.... This peace is not the peace that comes\nthrough conformity to the world. Christ never purchased peace\nby compromise with evil. The peace that Christ left His disciples\nis internal rather than external and was ever to remain with His\nwitnesses through strife and contention (The Acts of the Apostles,\n84)."

In the cross all influence centers, and\nfrom it all influence goes forth. It is the great center of attraction; for\non it Christ gave up His life for the human race. This sacrifice was\noffered for the purpose of restoring man to his original perfection.\nYea, more, it was offered to give him an entire transformation of\ncharacter, making him more than a conqueror. Those who in the\nstrength of Christ overcome the great enemy of God and man will\noccupy a position in the heavenly courts above angels who have\nnever fallen.\nChrist declares, “I, if I be lifted up ..., will draw all men unto\nme.” If the cross does not find an influence in its favor, it creates an\ninfluence. Through generation succeeding generation, the truth for\nthis time is revealed as present truth. Christ on the cross was the\nmedium whereby mercy and truth met together, and righteousness\nand peace kissed each other. This is the means that is to move the\nworld.\nIn the plan of God, all the riches of heaven are to be drawn upon\nby men. Nothing in the treasury of divine resources is deemed too\ncostly to accompany the great gift of the only begotten Son of God....\nChrist was empowered to breathe into fallen humanity the breath\nof life. Those who receive Him will never hunger, never thirst; for\ngreater joy than that found in Christ there cannot be. Study the\nwords spoken by the Saviour from the Mount of Blessing. How the\ndivine nature shone through His humanity as His lips uttered the\nbenedictions upon those who were the objects ofHis mercy andlove.\nHe blessed them with a fullness that showed that He was drawing\nfrom the inexhaustible store of the richest treasures. The treasures\nof eternity were at His command. The Father committed the riches\nCrossistheCenter,August4 461\nof heaven to Him, and in the disposal of them He knew no bound.\nThose who accept Him as their Saviour, their Redeemer, the Prince\nof life, he acknowledges before the heavenly host, before the worlds\nunfallen, and before the fallen world, as His peculiar treasure....\nWhat is Christianity? God’s instrumentality for the conversion\nof the sinner. Jesus will call to account everyone who is not brought\nunder His control, who does not demonstrate in his life the influence\nof the cross of Calvary. Christ should be uplifted by those whom He\nhas redeemed by dying on the cross a death of shame. He who has\nfelt the power of the grace of Christ has a story to tell. He seeks to\nput in operation methods of work which will diffuse the gospel of\nChrist. Humanity, drawing its efficiency from the great source of\nwisdom, is made the instrumentality, the working agency, through\nwhich the gospel exercises its transforming power on mind and heart\n(Manuscript 56, 1899)."

He says: “We are labourers\ntogether with God.” “Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord,\nand not unto men.” And Peter exhorts the believers: “As every man\nhath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as\ngood stewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man speak, let\nhim speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it\nas of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be\nglorified through Jesus Christ.”\nWhen these principles control our hearts, we shall realize that\nthe work is God’s, not ours; that He has the same care for every part\nof the great whole. When Christ and His glory are made first and\nlove of self is swallowed up in love for souls for whom Christ died,\nthen no worker will be so entirely absorbed in one branch of the\ncause as to lose sight of the importance of every other....\nWe are taught in God’s Word that this is the time, above all\nothers, when we may look for light from heaven. It is now that\nwe are to expect a refreshing from the presence of the Lord. We\nshould watch for the movings of God’s providence as the army of\nIsrael watched for “the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry\ntrees”—the appointed signal that heaven would work for them.\nGod cannot glorify His name through His people while they are\nleaning upon man and making flesh their arm. Their present state\nof weakness will continue until Christ alone shall be exalted; until,\nwith John the Baptist, they shall say from a humble and reverent\nheart: “He must increase, but I must decrease.” Words have been\ngiven me to speak to the people of God: “Lift Him up, the Man of\nCalvary. Let humanity stand back, that all may behold Him in whom\ntheir hopes of eternal life are centered. Says the prophet Isaiah:\nLiftHimUp,theManofCalvary,August5 463\n‘Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government\nshall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful,\nCounsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of\nPeace.’ Let the church and the world look upon their Redeemer. Let\nevery voice proclaim with John: ‘Behold the Lamb of God, which\ntaketh away the sin of the world.’”\nIt is to the thirsting soul that the fountain of living waters is open.\nGod declares: “I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods\nupon the dry ground.” To souls that are earnestly seeking for light\nand that accept with gladness every ray of divine illumination from\nHis Holy Word, to such alone light will be given. It is through these\nsouls that God will reveal that light and power which will lighten the\nwhole earth with His glory (Testimonies for the Church 5:726-729)."

Philippians 2:4, NIV.\nHow earnest, how touching, [Paul’s] appeal: “Ye know the grace\nof our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes\nhe became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.” You\nknow the height from which He stooped, the depth of humiliation\nto which He descended. His feet entered upon the path of sacrifice,\nand turned not aside until He had given His life. There was no rest\nfor Him between the throne in heaven and the cross. His love for\nman led Him to welcome every indignity and suffer every abuse.\nPaul admonishes us to “look not every man on his own things,\nbut every man also on the things of others.” He bids us possess the\nmind “which was also in Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of\nGod, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself\nof no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was\nmade in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man,\nhe humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death\nof the cross”....\n“Ye know,” says Peter, “that ye were not redeemed with cor-\nruptible things, as silver and gold” ... (1 Peter 1:18). Oh, had these\nbeen sufficient to purchase the salvation of man, how easily it might\nhave been accomplished by Him who says, “The silver is mine, and\nthe gold is mine”! (Haggai 2:8). But the sinner could be redeemed\nonly by the precious blood of the Son of God. Those who, failing\nto appreciate this wonderful sacrifice, withhold themselves from\nChrist’s service will perish in their selfishness....\nEveryone who accepts Christ as his personal Saviour will long\nfor the privilege of serving God. Contemplating what heaven has\ndone for him, his heart is moved with boundless love and adoring\ngratitude. He is eager to signalize his gratitude by devoting his\nGlorifytheMaster,August21 495\nabilities to God’s service. He longs to show his love for Christ and\nfor his purchased possession. He covets toil, hardship, sacrifice.\nThe true worker for God will do his best, because in so doing\nhe can glorify his Master. He will do right in order to regard the\nrequirements of God. He will endeavor to improve all his faculties.\nHe will perform every duty as unto God. His one desire will be that\nChrist may receive homage and perfect service.\nThere is a picture representing a bullock standing between a\nplow and an altar, with the inscription “Ready for either”—ready to\ntoil in the furrow or to be offered on the altar of sacrifice. This is the\nposition of the true child of God—willing to go where duty calls,\nto deny self, to sacrifice for the Redeemer’s cause (The Ministry of\nHealing, 501, 502)."

How trifling are our trials in comparison with Paul’s\nmany afflictions! They are not worthy to be compared with the\neternal weight of glory awaiting the overcomer. They are God’s\nworkmen, ordained for the perfection of character. However great\nthe deprivation and suffering of the Christian, however dark and\ninscrutable may seem the way of providence, he is to rejoice in the\nLord, knowing that all is working for his good.\nHow many there are who grieve the Spirit of God by continual\nrepining! This is because they have lost sight of Christ. If we behold\nHim who bore our sorrows and died as our sacrifice, that we might\nhave an exceeding weight of glory, we shall regard our heaviest\nsorrows and trials as light afflictions. Think of the Saviour upon the\ncross, bruised, smitten, mocked, yet uncomplaining and unresisting,\nsuffering without a murmur. This is the Lord of heaven, whose\nthrone is from everlasting, All this suffering and shame He endured\nfor the joy that was set before Him—the joy of bringing to men the\ngift of eternal life.\nWhen the attention is fastened on the cross of Christ, the whole\nbeing is ennobled. The knowledge of the Saviour’s love subdues the\nsoul, and lifts the mind above the things of time and sense. Let us\nlearn to estimate all temporal things in the light that shines from the\ncross. Let us strive to fathom the depths of humiliation to which our\nSaviour descended in order to make man the possessor of eternal\nriches.

But when we seek\nto tell of this love, language fails us. We think of His life on earth, of\nHis sacrifice for us; we think of His work in heaven as our advocate,\nof the mansions He is preparing for those who love Him; and we can\nbut exclaim, “O the heights and depths of the love of Christ!” As we\nlinger beneath the cross, we gain a faint conception of the love of\nGod, and we say, “Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he\nloved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” But in\nour contemplation of Christ, we are only lingering round the edge\nof a love that is measureless. His love is like a vast ocean, without\nbottom or shore.\nIn all true disciples this love, like sacred fire, burns on the altar\nof the heart.

Every vital part—the brain, the heart, the nerves—\nit touches with healing. By it the highest energies of the being are\nroused to activity. It frees the soul from the guilt and sorrow, the\nanxiety and care, that crush the life forces. With it come serenity\nand composure.

The cross of Calvary would be looked\nupon by the unfallen worlds, by the heavenly universe, by Satanic\nagencies, by the fallen race, and every mouth would be stopped. In\nmaking His infinite sacrifice Christ would exalt and honor the law.\nHe would make known the exalted character of God’s government,\nwhich could not in any way be changed to meet man in his sinful\ncondition.\nWho is able to describe the last scenes of Christ’s life on earth,\nHis trial in the judgment hall, His crucifixion? Who witnessed\nthese scenes? The heavenly universe, God the Father, Satan and his\nangels. Wonderful events took place in the betrayal of Christ. At\nHis mock trial, His accusers found nothing by which He could be\nproved guilty. Three times Pilate declared, “I find no fault in Him at\nall.” Nevertheless he ordered Him to be scourged, and then delivered\nHim up to suffer the most cruel death that could be devised....\nThe terrible scenes of the crucifixion revealed what humanity\nwill do when under Satan’s control. They revealed what the outcome\nwould be if Satan was to control the world. Those who witnessed\nthese scenes never lost the impressions made upon their minds.\nMany were converted, andtoldothers ofthe awfulscene they beheld.\nCrucifiedandRisenSaviour,August31 515\nMany who heard the report of Christ’s death were converted, and\ncommenced searching the Scriptures. Thus were fulfilled the words,\n“So shall he sprinkle many nations.”\n“Thus saith the Lord God; I will also take of the highest branch\nof the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his\nyoung twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain\nand eminent: in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it:\nand it shall ... be a goodly cedar; and under it shall dwell all fowl of\nevery wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.”\nChrist was this Branch, the highest branch of the highest cedar.\nHe was the plant of the Lord’s setting (The Signs of the Times, July\n12, 1899).\n516 LiftHimUp\nSeptember—Lift Him Up as the Healer of\nBody and Soul\nSpiritual and Physical Maladies Healed, September\nAnd Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues,\nand preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all\nmanner of sickness and all manner of disease among the\npeople. Matthew 4:23.\nThis world is a vast lazar house, but Christ came to heal the sick,\nto proclaim deliverance to the captives of Satan. He was in Himself\nhealth and strength. He imparted His life to the sick, the afflicted,\nthose possessed of demons. He turned away none who came to\nreceive His healing power. He knew that those who petitioned Him\nfor help had brought disease upon themselves; yet He did not refuse\nto heal them. And when virtue from Christ entered into these poor\nsouls, they were convicted of sin, and many were healed of their\nspiritual disease, as well as of their physical maladies. The gospel\nstill possesses the same power, and why should we not today witness\nthe same results?\nChrist feels the woes of every sufferer. When evil spirits rend a\nhuman frame, Christ feels the curse. When fever is burning up the\nlife current, He feels the agony. And He is just as willing to heal\nthe sick now as when He was personally on earth. Christ’s servants\nare His representatives, the channels for His working. He desires\nthrough them to exercise His healing power.\nIn the Saviour’s manner of healing there were lessons for His\ndisciples. On one occasion He anointed the eyes of a blind man with\nclay, and bade him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam.... He went his\nway therefore, and washed, and came seeing” (John 9:7). The cure\ncould be wrought only by the power of the Great Healer, yet Christ\nmade use of the simple agencies of nature....\nTo many of the afflicted ones who received healing, Christ said,\n“Sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee” (John 5:14). Thus\nHe taught that disease is the result of violating God’s laws, both\nSpiritualandPhysicalMaladiesHealed,September1 519\nnatural and spiritual. The great misery in the world would not exist\ndid men but live in harmony with the Creator’s plan.\nChrist had been the guide and teacher of ancient Israel, and He\ntaught them that health is the reward of obedience to the laws of\nGod. The Great Physician who healed the sick in Palestine had\nspoken to His people from the pillar of cloud, telling them what they\nmust do, and what God would do for them. “If thou wilt diligently\nhearken to the voice of the Lord thy God,” He said, “and wilt do that\nwhich is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments,\nand keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee,\nwhich I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that\nhealeth thee” (Exodus 15:26).... When they fulfilled the conditions,\nthe promise was verified to them. “There was not one feeble person\namong their tribes” (Psalm 105:37) (The Desire of Ages, 823, 824)."

Everywhere, whether in\nthe church, at our homes, or in social intercourse with our neighbors,\nwe should let the lovely image of Jesus appear. This we cannot do\nunless we are filled with His fullness. If we would become better\nacquainted with Jesus, we should love Him for His goodness and\nexcellence and we should desire to become so assimilated to His\ndivine character that all would know that we had been with Jesus,\nand learned of Him.\nIt is by carrying out in our lives the pure principles of the gospel\nof Christ that we honor and glorify our Father, who is in heaven.\nWhen we are doing this, we are reflecting Heaven-given light upon\nthe dark world around us. Sinners will be constrained to confess that\nwe are not the children of darkness, but the children of light. How\nshall they know this? By the fruits we bear. Men may have their\nnames upon the church book; but that does not make them children\nof light. They may hold honorable positions and receive the praise\nof men; but that does not make them children of light.... There must\nbe a deep work of grace—the love of God in the heart, and this love\nis expressed by obedience.\nIt is Christ dwelling in the soul that gives us spiritual power, and\nmakes us channels oflight. The more lightwe have, the more we can\nimpart to others around us. The more closely we live to Jesus, the\nclearer views shall we have of His loveliness. As we behold Him in\nHis purity, we discern more clearly our own faults of character. We\nyearn after Him, and for that fullness that is in Him, and that shines\nout in the perfection of His heavenly character; and by beholding\nwe become changed into His image....\nSpiritualPower,September9 535\nEveryday we are sowing some kind of seed. If we sow the seeds\nof unbelief, we shall reap unbelief; if we sow pride, we shall reap\npride; if we sow stubbornness, we shall reap stubbornness, “for\nwhatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap”....\nOur hearts may be filled with all the fullness of God; but there\nis something for us to do. We must not pet our faults and sins, but\nput them away, and make haste to set our hearts in order. When this\nis done, let us take the key of faith, and unlock the storehouse of\nGod’s rich blessings.... There is an infinite fullness to draw from;\nand we have the promise of our divine Lord, “According to your\nfaith be it unto you.” We may win the crown of life, a place at God’s\nright hand, and as we enter the pearly gates, hear the words, sweeter\nthan any music, “Well done, good and faithful servant: ... enter thou\ninto the joy of thy lord” (Matthew 25:23) (The Signs of the Times,"

And the things that thou hast heard of me among many\nwitnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be\nable to teach others also. 2 Timothy 2:1, 2.\nThe lessons contained in the words of Paul to Timothy are of the\ngreatest importance to us today. He charges him to “be strong”—in\nhis own wisdom? No, but “in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.”\nHe who would be a follower of Christ is not to rely upon his own\ncapabilities, or to feel confident in himself. Neither is to be dwarfed\ninhisreligiousefforts,toshunresponsibilities,andremaininefficient\nin the cause of God. He is to draw strength from a sure and safe\nsource, that never fails those who would have divine power. The\nexhortation to us is, “Be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.” If\nthe Christian feels his weakness, his inability, by putting his trust in\nGod, he will find the grace of Christ sufficient for every emergency.\nThe soldier of Christ must meet many forms of temptation, and\nresist and overcome them. The fiercer the conflict, the greater the\nsupply of grace to meet the need of the soul; and the very nature of\nthe grace received will enlarge the capacity of the servant of Christ\nto know God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent. The soul of\nthe believer will go out in intense longing to know and understand\nmore of the truth and righteousness of Christ. All who advance\nin the divine life will have increased ability to search for truth as\nfor hid treasure, and will appropriate the truth to their own souls.\nThe true Christian will understand what it means to pass through\nsevere conflicts and trying experiences; but he will steadily increase\nin the grace of Christ to meet successfully the enemy of his soul,\nwho works through human agency to cause the ruin of the servants\nof Christ. By passing through severe ordeals of trial, the follower\nof Christ will better understand the ways of God and the plan of\nredemption, and will not be ignorant of the devices of the enemy.\nBeStronginHisGrace,September10 537\nThe darkness will press upon his soul at times; but the true light\nwill shine, the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness will dispel\nthe gloom; and although Satan seeks in every way to discourage\nhim by presenting obstacles before him, through the grace of Christ\nhe will be enabled to be a faithful witness of the things which he\nhas heard from the inspired messenger of God. He does not despise\nor neglect the message received, but commits his knowledge to\nfaithful men, who in their turn are to be able to teach others also. In\ncommunicating the light to others, the Christian proves the truth of\nthe word that “the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth\nmore and more unto the perfect day” (Proverbs 4:18) (The Review"

To\nkeep the body in a healthy condition to develop its strength, that\nevery part of the living machinery may act harmoniously, should\nbe the first study of our life. To neglect the body is to neglect the\nmind. It cannot be to the glory of God for His children to have sickly\nbodies or dwarfed minds. To indulge the taste at the expense of\nhealth is a wicked abuse of the senses....\nThe Redeemer of the world knew that the indulgence of appetite\nwould bring physical debility, and so deaden the perceptive organs\nthat sacred and eternal things would not be discerned.

His water\nsupply fails, and he has nothing with which to slake his burning\nthirst. His tongue becomes swollen; he staggers like a drunken man.\nVisions of home and friends pass before his mind as he believes\nhimself ready to perish. Suddenly he sees in the distance, rising out\nof the dreary, sandy waste, a palm tree, green and flourishing. Hope\nquickens his pulses; he presses on, knowing that that which gives\nvigor and freshness to the palm tree will cool his fevered blood and\ngive him renewed life.\nAs is the palm tree in the desert—a guide and a consolation to\nthe fainting traveler—so the Christian is to be in the world. He is to\nguide weary souls, full of unrest, and ready to perish in the desert\nof sin, to the living water. He is to point his fellowmen to Him who\ngives to all the invitation, “If any man thirst, let him come unto me,\nand drink.”\nThe sky may be as brass, the burning sand may beat about the\npalm tree’s roots, and pile itself about its trunk; yet the tree lives on,\nfresh and vigorous. Remove the sand, and you discover the secret of\nits life; its roots strike down deep into the waters hidden in the earth.\nThus it is with the Christian. His life is hid with Christ in God.\nJesus is to him a well of water, springing up unto everlasting life.\nHis faith, like the rootlets of the palm tree, penetrates beneath the\nthings that are seen, drawing life from the fountain of life. And,\namid all the corruption of the world, he is true and loyal to God.\nThe sweet influence of Christ’s righteousness surrounds him. His\ninfluence elevates and blesses.\nThe humblest and poorest of the disciples of Jesus can be a\nblessing to others.

They are not required to\nweary themselves with anxiety about success. They have only to go\nforward quietly, doing faithfully the work God’s providence assigns,\nand their life will not be in vain. Their own souls will be growing\nmore and more into the likeness of Christ; they are workers together\nwith God in this life, and are thus fitting for the higher work and the\nunshadowed joy of the life to come (The Signs of the Times, August\n6, 1902)."

        "content": "Jesus invites the weary and care-laden sons and daughters of\nAdam to come to Him, and lay on Him their heavy burdens. But\nmany who hear this invitation, while sighing for rest, yet press on\nthe rugged path, hugging their burdens close to their heart. Jesus\nloves them, and longs to bear their burdens and themselves also in\nHis strong arms. He would remove the fears and uncertainties that\nrob them of peace and rest; but they must first come to Him, and tell\nHim the secret woes of their heart. He invites the confidence of His\npeople as the proof of their love for Him. The gift of the humble,\ntrusting heart is more precious to Him than all the wealth that riches\ncan bestow. If they would only come to Him in the simplicity and\nconfidence with which a child would come to His parents, the divine\ntouch of His hands would relieve them of their burdens.\nJesus, our compassionate Saviour, is the way, the truth, and the\nlife. Why will we not accept His gracious offer of mercy, believe\nHis words of promise, and not make the way of life so hard? ... The\nways of Christ are ways of pleasantness, and all His paths are peace.\nIf we have made rough paths for our feet, and taken heavy burdens\nof care in laying up for ourselves treasures upon the earth, let us now\nchange, and follow the path Jesus has prepared for us.\nWe are not always willing to come to Jesus with our trials and\ndifficulties. Sometimes we pour our troubles into human ears, and\ntellourafflictionsto thosewho cannothelpus, andneglectto confide\nall to Jesus, who is able to change the sorrowful way to paths of\njoy and peace.... Oh, that all, ministers and people, would take their\nburdens and perplexities to Jesus, who is waiting to receive them,\nand to give them peace and rest! (The Signs of the Times, March\n17, 1887).\nChristHasPromisedUsRest,September20 557\nIt is a terribly hard struggle to give up your own will and your\nown way. But this lesson learned, you will find rest and peace.\nPride, selfishness, and ambition must be overcome; your will must\nbe swallowed up in the will of Christ. The whole life may become\none constant love sacrifice, every action a manifestation, and every\nword an utterance of love. As the life of the vine circulates through\nstem and cluster, descends into the lower fibers, and reaches to the\ntopmost leaf, so will the grace and love of Christ burn and abound in\nthe soul, sending its virtues to every part of the being, and pervading\nevery exercise of body and mind (The S.D.A. Bible Commentary,\nEllen G. White Comments, vol. 5, 1091, 1092)."

        "verse_ref": " Ephesians 1:3",
        "content": "“God, who is richin mercy, forhis greatlove wherewithhe loved\nus, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with\nChrist, ... and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in\nheavenly places in Christ Jesus: that in the ages to come he might\nshow the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us\nthrough Christ Jesus.”\nSuch are the words in which “Paul the aged,” “a prisoner of\nJesus Christ,” writing from his prison house at Rome, endeavored\nto set before his brethren that which he found language inadequate\nto express in its fullness—“the unsearchable riches of Christ,” the\ntreasure of grace freely offered to the fallen sons of men. The plan\nof redemption was laid by a sacrifice, a gift. Says the apostle: “Ye\nknow the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich,\nyet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might\nbe rich”.... And as the crowning blessing of redemption, “the gift of\nGod is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord”.... Surely there\nare none that, beholding the riches of grace, can forbear to exclaim\nwith the apostle: “Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.”\nAs the plan of redemption begins and ends with a gift, so it is\nto be carried forward. The same spirit of sacrifice which purchased\nsalvation for us will dwell in the hearts of all who become partakers\nof the heavenly gift. Says the apostle Peter: “As every man hath\nreceived the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good\nstewards of the manifold grace of God.” Said Jesus to His disciples\nas He sent them forth: “Freely ye have received, freely give.” In him\nwho is fully in sympathy with Christ there can be nothing selfish or\nexclusive. He who drinks of the living water will find that it is “in\nhim a well of water springing up into everlasting life.” The Spirit of\nPlanofRedemptionaGift,September21 559\nChrist within him is like a spring welling up in the desert, flowing\nto refresh all, and making those who are ready to perish eager to\ndrink of the water of life. It was the same spirit of love and self-\nsacrifice which dwelt in Christ that impelled the apostle Paul to his\nmanifold labors. “I am debtor,” he says, “both to the Greeks, and to\nthe Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise” (Romans 1:14).\n“Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given,\nthat I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of\nChrist” (Ephesians 3:8) (Testimonies for the Church 5:730, 731)."

He does not become perplexed\nby the multiplicity of our grievances nor overpowered by the weight\nof our burdens. His watchcare extends to every household and en-\nriches every individual; He is concerned in all our business and our\nsorrows. He marks every tear; He is touched with the feeling of\nour infirmities. All the afflictions and trials that befall us here are\npermitted, to work out His purposes of love toward us, “that we\nmight be partakers of his holiness,” and thus become participants in\nthat fullness of joy which is found in His presence....\nThe Bible in strongest terms sets before us the importance of\nobtaining a knowledge of God. Says Peter: “Grace and peace be\nmultiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our\nLord.” “His divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain\nunto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath\ncalled us to glory and virtue.” And the Scripture bids us: “Acquaint\nnow thyself with him, and be at peace.”\nGod has commanded us, “Ye shall be holy; for I the Lord your\nGod am holy”; and an inspired apostle declares that without holiness\n“no man shall see the Lord.” Holiness is agreement with God. By sin\nthe image of God in man has been marred and well-nigh obliterated;\nit is the work of the gospel to restore that which has been lost; and\nwe are to cooperate with the divine agency in this work. And how\ncan we come into harmony with God, how shall we receive His\nPowerofGod’sLove,September22 561\nlikeness, unless we obtain a knowledge of Him? It is this knowledge\nthat Christ came into the world to reveal unto us.\nThe meager views which so many have had of the exalted char-\nacter and office of Christ have narrowed their religious experience\nand have greatly hindered their progress in the divine life. Personal\nreligion among us as a people is at a low ebb. There is much form,\nmuch machinery, much tongue religion; but something deeper and\nmore solidmustbe broughtinto ourreligious experience.... Whatwe\nneed is to know God and the power of His love, as revealed in Christ,\nby an experimental knowledge. We must search the Scriptures dili-\ngently, prayerfully; our understanding must be quickened by the\nHoly Spirit, and our hearts must be uplifted to God in faith and hope\nand continual praise (Testimonies for the Church 5:742-744)."

True humility will lead a man to exalt\nChrist and the truth, and to realize his utter dependence upon the\nGod of truth.

Song of Solomon 4:15, NIV.\nIt is through personal contact and association that men are\nreached by the saving power of the gospel. They are not saved\nas masses, but as individuals. Personal influence is a power. It is to\nwork with the influence of Christ, to lift where Christ lifts, to impart\ncorrect principles, and to stay the progress of the world’s corruption.\nIt is to diffuse that grace which Christ alone can impart. It is to\nuplift, to sweeten the lives and characters of others by the power of\na pure example united with earnest faith and love....\nThrough sin, the whole human organism is deranged, the mind\nis perverted, the imagination corrupted; the faculties of the soul are\ndegraded. There is an absence of pure religion, of heart holiness.\nThe converting power of God has not wrought in transforming the\ncharacter. Thesoulisweak, andforwantofmoralforcetoovercome,\nis polluted and debased.\nTo the heart that has become purified, all is changed. Transfor-\nmation of character is the testimony to the world of an indwelling\nChrist. The Spirit of God produces a new life in the soul, bringing\nthe thoughts and desires into obedience to the will of Christ; and the\ninward man is renewed in the image of God. Weak and erring men\nand women show to the world that the redeeming power of grace can\ncause the faulty character to develop into symmetry and abundant\nfruitfulness.\nThe heart that receives the Word of God is not as a pool that\nevaporates, not like a broken cistern that loses its treasure. It is like\nthe mountain stream, fed by unfailing springs, whose cool, sparkling\nwaters leap from rock to rock, refreshing the weary, the thirsty, the\nheavy-laden. It is like a river constantly flowing and, as it advances,\nbecoming deeper and wider, until its life-giving waters are spread\nover all the earth....\nPersonalInfluenceisaPower,September29 575\nSo it is with the true child of God. The religion of Christ reveals\nitself as a vitalizing, pervading principle, a living, working, spiritual\nenergy. When the heart is opened to the heavenly influence of truth\nand love, these principles will flow forth again like streams in the\ndesert, causing fruitfulness to appear where now are barrenness and\ndearth.\nAsthosewho havebeen cleansedandsanctifiedthroughaknowl-\nedge of Bible truth engage heartily in the work of soul saving, they\nwill become indeed a savor of life unto life. And as daily they drink\nof the inexhaustible fountain of grace and knowledge, they will find\nthat their own hearts are filled to overflowing with the Spirit of their\nMaster, and that through their unselfish ministry many are benefited\nphysically, mentally, and spiritually. The weary are refreshed, the\nsick restored to health, and the sin-burdened relieved (Prophets and\nKings, 232-234)."

True Christians will not exult in exposing the faults and\ndeficiencies of others. They will ... fix the mind upon that which\nis attractive and lovely.

The great Head of the\nchurch superintends His work through the instrumentality of men\nordained by God to act as His representatives.\nThe position of those who have been called of God to labor in\nword and doctrine for the upbuilding of His church is one of grave\nresponsibility. In Christ’s stead they are to beseech men and women\nto be reconciled to God, and they can fulfill their mission only as\nthey receive wisdom and power from above.\nChrist’s ministers are the spiritual guardians of the people en-\ntrusted to their care. Their work has been likened to that of watch-\nmen. In ancient times sentinels were often stationed on the walls of\ncities, where, from points of vantage, they could overlook important\nposts to be guarded, and give warning of the approach of an enemy.\nUpon their faithfulness depended the safety of all within. At stated\nintervals they were required to call to one another, to make sure that\nall were awake and that no harm had befallen any. The cry of good\ncheer or of warning was borne from one to another, each repeating\nthe call till it echoed round the city....\nIt is the privilege of the watchmen on the walls of Zion to live\nso near to God, and to be so susceptible to the impressions of His\nSpirit, that He can work through them to tell men and women of\ntheir peril and point them to the place of safety. Faithfully are they\nto warn them of the sure result of transgression, and faithfully are\nthey to safeguard the interests of the church. At no time may they\nrelax their vigilance....

We are constantly\nreceiving of God’s bounty, and by imparting of the same we are to\nrepresent to the world the love and beneficence of Christ. While all\nheaven is astir, dispatching messengers to every part of the earth\nto carry forward the work of redemption, the church of the living\nGod are also to be colaborers with Christ. We are members of His\nmystical body. He is the head, controlling all the members of the\nbody. Jesus Himself, in His infinite mercy, is working on human\nhearts, effecting spiritual transformations so amazing that angels\nlook on with astonishment and joy. The same unselfish love that\ncharacterizes the Master is seen in the character and life of His true\nfollowers. Christ expects that men will become partakers of His\ndivine nature while in this world, thus not only reflecting His glory\nto the praise of God, but illumining the darkness of the world with\nthe radiance of heaven. Thus will be fulfilled the words of Christ:\n“Ye are the light of the world.”\n“We are labourers together with God,” “stewards of the manifold\ngrace of God.” The knowledge of God’s grace, the truths of His\nWord, and temporal gifts as well—time and means, talents and\ninfluence—are all a trust from God to be employed to His glory and\nthe salvation of men. Nothing can be more offensive to God, who is\nconstantly bestowing His gifts upon man, than to see him selfishly\ngrasping these gifts and making no returns to the Giver. Jesus is\ntoday in heaven preparing mansions for those who love Him; yes,\nmore than mansions, a kingdom which is to be ours.

They are to have power to\nresist evil, power that neither earth, nor death, nor hell can master,\npower that will enable them to overcome as Christ overcame.\nChrist designs that heaven’s order, heaven’s plan of government,\nheaven’s divine harmony, shall be represented in His church on\nearth. Thus in His people He is glorified. Through them the Sun\nof righteousness will shine in undimmed luster to the world. Christ\nhas given to His church ample facilities, that He may receive a large\nrevenue of glory from His redeemed, purchased possession.

        "content": "In this last meeting with His disciples, the great desire which\nChrist expressed for them was that they might love one another as\nHe had loved them. Again and again He spoke of this. “These things\nI command you,” He said repeatedly, “that ye love one another.” His\nvery first injunction when alone with them in the upper chamber was\n“A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as\nI have loved you, that ye also love one another.” To the disciples this\ncommandmentwas new; forthey hadnotlovedone anotheras Christ\nhad loved them. He saw that new ideas and impulses must control\nthem; that new principles must be practiced by them; through His\nlife and death they were to receive a new conception of love. The\ncommand to love one another had a new meaning in the light of His\nself-sacrifice. The whole work of grace is one continual service of\nlove, of self-denying, self-sacrificing effort. During every hour of\nChrist’s sojourn upon the earth, the love of God was flowing from\nHim in irrepressible streams. All who are imbued with His Spirit\nwill love as He loved. The very principle that actuated Christ will\nactuate them in all their dealing one with another.\nThis love is the evidence of their discipleship. “By this shall\nall men know that ye are my disciples,” said Jesus, “if ye have love\none to another.” When men are bound together, not by force or self-\ninterest, but by love, they show the working of an influence that\nis above every human influence. Where this oneness exists, it is\nevidence that the image of God is being restored in humanity, that\na new principle of life has been implanted. It shows that there is\npower in the divine nature to withstand the supernatural agencies of\nevil, and that the grace of God subdues the selfishness inherent in\nthe natural heart.\nLove—TheEvidenceofDiscipleship,October11 601\nThis love, manifested in the church, will surely stir the wrath of\nSatan. Christ did not mark out for His disciples an easy path. “If\nthe world hate you,” He said, “ye know that it hated me before it\nhated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own:\nbut because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the\nworld, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I\nsaid unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have\npersecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my\nsaying, they will keep yours also. But all these things will they do\nunto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent\nme.” The gospel is to be carried forward by aggressive warfare, in\nthe midst of opposition, peril, loss, and suffering. But those who do\nthis work are only following in their Master’s steps (The Desire of\nAges, 677, 678)."

With prophetic eye Christ traced the\nscenes to take place in His last great conflict. He knew that when He\nshould exclaim, “It is finished,” all heaven would triumph. His ear\ncaught the distant music and the shouts of victory in the heavenly\ncourts. He knew that the knell of Satan’s empire would then be\nTruthWillConquer,October13 605\nsounded, and the name of Christ would be heralded from world to\nworld throughout the universe.\nChrist rejoiced that He could do more for His followers than\nthey could ask or think.

By the Christian, God’s love and benevolence\ncan be seen in every bounty he receives. The beauties in nature\nare a theme for contemplation. In studying the natural loveliness\nsurrounding us, the mind is carried up through nature to the Author\nof all that is lovely.

Christ\ndeclared that the truths of the Old Testament are as valuable as those\nof the New. Christ was as much man’s Redeemer in the beginning\nof the world as He is today. Before He clothed His divinity with\nhumanity and came to our world, the gospel message was given by\nAdam, Seth, Enoch, Methuselah, andNoah. Abraham in Canaan and\nLot in Sodom bore the message, and from generation to generation\nfaithful messengers proclaimed the Coming One....\nOf Christ’s life and death and intercession, which prophets had\nforetold, the apostles were to go forth as witnesses. Christ in His\nhumiliation, in His purity and holiness, in His matchless love, was\nto be their theme. And in order to preach the gospel in its fullness,\nthey must present the Saviour not only as revealed in His life and\nteachings, but as foretold by the prophets of the Old Testament and\nas symbolized by the sacrificial service....\nIn every age there is a new development of truth, a message of\nGod to the people of that generation. The old truths are all essential;\nnew truth is not independent of the old, but an unfolding of it. It\nis only as the old truths are understood that we can comprehend\nthe new. When Christ desired to open to His disciples the truth of\nHis resurrection, He began “at Moses and all the prophets,” and\n“expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning\nhimself” (Luke 24:27). But it is the light which shines in the fresh\nunfolding of truth that glorifies the old. He who rejects or neglects\nthe new does not really possess the old. For him it loses its vital\npower and becomes but a lifeless form.\nThere are those who profess to believe and to teach the truths\nof the Old Testament, while they reject the New. But in refusing to\nRootandFruit,October19 617\nreceive the teachings of Christ, they show that they do not believe\nthat which patriarchs and prophets have spoken....\nIn rejecting the Old, they virtually reject the New; for both are\nparts of an inseparable whole. No man can rightly present the law\nof God without the gospel, or the gospel without the law. The law is\nthe gospel embodied, and the gospel is the law unfolded. The law is\nthe root, the gospel is the fragrant blossom and fruit which it bears.\nThe Old Testament sheds light upon the New, and the New upon\nthe Old. Each is a revelation of the glory of God in Christ. Both\npresent truths that will continually reveal new depths of meaning to\nthe earnest seeker (Christ’s Object Lessons, 126-128)."

There is nothing\nthat the world needs so much as the manifestation through humanity\nof the Saviour’s love. All heaven is waiting for men and women\nthrough whom God can reveal the power of Christianity.\nThe church is God’s agency for the proclamation of truth, em-\npowered by Him to do a special work; and if she is loyal to Him,\nobedient to all His commandments, there will dwell within her the\nexcellency of divine grace. If she will be true to her allegiance, if\nshe will honor the Lord God of Israel, there is no power that can\nstand against her.\nZeal for God and His cause moved the disciples to bear witness\nto the gospel with mighty power. Should not a like zeal fire our\nhearts with a determination to tell the story of redeeming love, of\nChrist and Him crucified? It is the privilege of every Christian, not\nonly to look for, but to hasten the coming of the Saviour.\nIf the church will put on the robe of Christ’s righteousness,\nwithdrawing from all allegiance with the world, there is before her\nthe dawn of a bright and glorious day. God’s promise to her will\nstand fast forever. He will make her an eternal excellency, a joy of\nmany generations. Truth, passing by those who despise and reject\nit, will triumph. Although at times apparently retarded, its progress\nhas never been checked. When the message of God meets with\nopposition, He gives it additional force, that it may exert greater\nChurchwillTriumph,October28 635\ninfluence. Endowed with divine energy, it will cut its way through\nthe strongest barriers and triumph over every obstacle.\nWhat sustained the Son of God during His life of toil and sacri-\nfice? He saw the results of the travail of His soul and was satisfied.\nLooking into eternity, He beheld the happiness of those who through\nHis humiliation had received pardon and everlasting life. His ear\ncaught the shout of the redeemed. He heard the ransomed ones\nsinging the song of Moses and the Lamb....\nBy faith we may stand on the threshold of the eternal city, and\nhear the gracious welcome given to those who in this life cooperate\nwith Christ (The Acts of the Apostles, 600, 601)."

In the typical\nservice, while the high priest was making the atonement for Israel,\nall were required to afflict their souls by repentance of sin and humil-\niation before the Lord, lest they be cut off from among the people. In\nlike manner, all who would have their names retained in the book of\nlife should now, in the few remaining days of their probation, afflict\ntheir souls before God by sorrow for sin and true repentance. There\nmust be deep, faithful searching of heart. The light, frivolous spirit\nindulged by so many professed Christians must be put away. There\nis earnest warfare before all who would subdue the evil tendencies\nthat strive for the mastery. The work of preparation is an individual\nwork. We are not saved in groups. The purity and devotion of one\nwill not offset the want of these qualities in another. Though all\nnations are to pass in judgment before God, yet He will examine\nthe case of each individual with as close and searching scrutiny as\nif there were not another being upon the earth. Everyone must be\ntested and found without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.\nSolemn are the scenes connected with the closing work of the\natonement. Momentous are the interests involved therein. The\njudgment is now passing in the sanctuary above. For many years\nthis work has been in progress. Soon—none know how soon—it\nwill pass to the cases of the living. In the awful presence of God\nour lives are to come up in review. At this time above all others it\nbehooves every soul to heed the Saviour’s admonition: “Watch and\npray: for ye know not when the time is” (Mark 13:33). “If therefore\nthou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt\nnot know what hour I will come upon thee” (Revelation 3:3).\nLivingintheGreatDayofAtonement,November12 667\nWhen the work of the investigative judgment closes, the destiny\nof all will have been decided for life or death. Probation is ended a\nshort time before the appearing of the Lord in the clouds of heaven.\nChrist in the Revelation, looking forward to that time, declares: “He\nthat is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him\nbe filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and\nhe that is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly;\nand my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work\nshall be” (Revelation 22:11, 12) (The Great Controversy, 489-491).\nIn the typical service the high priest, having made the atonement\nfor Israel, came forth and blessed the congregation. So Christ, at\nthe close of His work as mediator, will appear, “without sin unto\nsalvation” (Hebrews 9:28), to bless His waiting people with eternal\nlife (The Great Controversy, 485)."

But to the lowly, the\nsuffering, the faithful, the patient, who are alive to their weakness\nand insufficiency, are given words of encouragement: “Behold, I\nstand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open\nthe door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with\nme”....\nOur Lord delays because of His “longsuffering to us-ward, not\nwilling that any should perish, but that all should come to repen-\ntance.” But when we, with all the redeemed, shall stand upon the sea\nof glass, with harps of gold and crowns of glory, and before us the\nimmensity of eternity, then we shall see how short was the waiting\nperiod of probation. “Blessed are those servants, whom the lord\nwhen he cometh shall find watching” (Luke 12:37) (Testimonies for\nthe Church 5:483-485).\n[339] Faithful Mothers Honored in the Judgment,"

Joshua\n24:15, NIV.\nTo effect the salvation of men, God employs various agencies.\nHe speaks to them by His Word and by His ministers, and He sends\nby the Holy Spirit messages of warning, reproof, and instruction.\nThese means are designed to enlighten the understanding of the\npeople, to reveal to them their duty and their sins, and the blessings\nwhich they may receive; to awaken in them a sense of spiritual want,\nthat they may go to Christ and find in Him the grace they need. But\nmany choose to follow their own way instead of God’s way. They\nare not reconciled to God, neither can be, until self is crucified and\nChrist lives in the heart by faith.\nEvery individual, by his own act, either puts Christ from him\nby refusing to cherish His spirit and follow His example, or he\nenters into a personal union with Christ by self-renunciation, faith,\nand obedience. We must, each for himself, choose Christ, because\nHe has first chosen us. This union with Christ is to be formed by\nthose who are naturally at enmity with Him. It is a relation of utter\ndependence, to be entered into by a proud heart. This is close work,\nand many who profess to be followers of Christ know nothing of it.\nThey nominally accept the Saviour, but not as the sole ruler of their\nhearts.\nSome feel their need of the atonement, and with the recognition\nof this need, and the desire for a change of heart, a struggle begins.\nTo renounce their own will, perhaps their chosen objects of affection\nor pursuit, requires an effort, at which many hesitate and falter and\nturn back. Yet this battle must be fought by every heart that is truly\nconverted. We must war against temptations without and within.\nWe must gain the victory over self, crucify the affections and lusts;\nand then begins the union of the soul with Christ. As the dry and\napparently lifeless branch is grafted into the living tree, so may we\nChooseChristforYourself,November22 687\nbecome living branches of the True Vine. And the fruit which was\nborne by Christ will be borne by all His followers. After this union\nis formed, it can be preserved only by continual, earnest, painstaking\neffort. Christ exercises His power to preserve and guard this sacred\ntie, and the dependent, helpless sinner must act his part with untiring\nenergy....\nEvery Christian must stand on guard continually, watching every\navenue of the soul where Satan might find access. He must pray for\ndivine help and at the same time resolutely resist every inclination\nto sin. By courage, by faith, by persevering toil, he can conquer.\nBut let him remember that to gain the victory Christ must abide in\nhim and he in Christ.... It is only by personal union with Christ, by\ncommunion with Him daily, hourly, that we can bear the fruits of\nthe Holy Spirit (Testimonies for the Church 5:46-48)."

        "content": "As many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;\n(for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the\ndoers of the law shall be justified). Romans 2:12, 13.\nThose who had accepted the light concerning the mediation of\nChrist and the perpetuity of the law of God found that these were\nthe truths presented in Revelation 14. The messages of this chapter\nconstitute a threefold warning which is to prepare the inhabitants of\nthe earth for the Lord’s second coming. The announcement, “The\nhour of his judgment is come,” points to the closing work of Christ’s\nministration for the salvation of men. It heralds a truth which must\nbe proclaimed until the Saviour’s intercession shall cease and He\nshall return to the earth to take His people to Himself. The work of\njudgment which began in 1844 must continue until the cases of all\nare decided, both of the living and the dead; hence it will extend to\nthe close of human probation. That men may be prepared to stand in\nthe judgment, the message commands them to “fear God, and give\nglory to him,” “and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and\nthe sea, and the fountains of waters.” The result of an acceptance\nof these messages is given in the Word: “Here are they that keep\nthe commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” In order to be\nprepared for the judgment, it is necessary that men should keep\nthe law of God. That law will be the standard of character in the\njudgment. The apostle Paul declares: “As many as have sinned in the\nlaw shall be judged by the law, ... in the day when God shall judge\nthe secrets of men by Jesus Christ.” And he says that “the doers\nof the law shall be justified” (Romans 2:12-16). Faith is essential\nin order to the keeping of the law of God; for “without faith it is\nimpossible to please him.” And “whatsoever is not of faith is sin”\n(Hebrews 11:6; Romans 14:23)."

But it was victory through Jesus Christ that made the\ncrown of life so desirable to him. Jesus would not have us ambitious\nto obtain reward, but ambitious to do God’s will because it is His\nwill, irrespective of the reward we are to receive.\nThe gift of God is eternal life. The Lord desires all who receive\nHis grace to trust entirely in Him. He calls upon us to exercise\npure, simple faith, trusting in Him, without a question as to what\nrecompense we shall receive. We are to work heartily in His ser-\nvice, showing that we have perfect confidence that He will judge\nrighteously.\nIn the account of the judgment scene, when the reward is given\nto the righteous, and sentence is passed on the wicked, the righteous\nare represented as wondering what they have done that they should\nreceive such reward. But they cherished an abiding faith in Christ.\nThey were imbued with His Spirit, and, without conscious effort,\nthey performed for Christ, in the person of His saints, those services\nthat bring a sure reward.

The doctrine of\nthe Second Advent had been neglected; the scriptures relating to it\nwere obscured by misinterpretation, until it was, to a great extent,\nignored and forgotten. Especially was this the case in the churches\nof America. The freedom and comfort enjoyed by all classes of\nsociety, the ambitious desire for wealth and luxury, begetting an\nabsorbing devotion to money-making, the eager rush for popularity\nand power, which seemed to be within the reach of all, led men to\ncenter their interests and hopes on the things of this life, and to put\nfar in the future that solemn day when the present order of things\nshould pass away.\nWhen the Saviour pointed out to His followers the signs of His\nreturn, He foretold the state of backsliding that would exist just prior\nto His second advent.

Let\nus seek most earnestly for the heavenly anointing, the Holy Spirit\n(Medical Ministry, 22).\n[350] Enoch and the Second Coming of Christ, December\nAnd Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied ... saying,\nBehold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to\nexecute judgment upon all. Jude 14, 15.\nThepureandlovelyGarden ofEden, from whichourfirstparents\nwere driven, remained until God purposed to destroy the earth by a\nflood. God had planted that garden and specially blessed it, and in\nHis wonderful providence He withdrew it from the earth, and will\nreturn it to the earth again more gloriously adorned than before it\nwas removed from the earth. God purposed to preserve a specimen\nof His perfect work of creation free from the curse wherewith He\nhad cursed the earth.\nThe Lord opened more fully to Enoch the plan of salvation, and\nby the Spirit of prophecy carried him down through the generations\nwhich should live after the Flood, and showed him the great events\nconnected with the second coming of Christ and the end of the world\n(Jude 14).\nEnoch was troubled in regard to the dead. It seemed to him\nthat the righteous and the wicked would go to the dust together,\nand that would be their end. He could not clearly see the life of\nthe just beyond the grave. In prophetic vision he was instructed\nin regard to the Son of God, who was to die man’s sacrifice, and\nwas shown the coming of Christ in the clouds of heaven, attended\nby the angelic host, to give life to the righteous dead and ransom\nthem from their graves. He also saw the corrupt state of the world\nat the time when Christ should appear the second time—that there\nwould be a boastful, presumptuous, self-willed generation arrayed in\nrebellion against the law of God and denying the only Lord God and\nour Lord Jesus Christ, and trampling upon His blood and despising\nHis atonement.

But they must wait yet a little longer. The people of\nGod must drink of the cup and be baptized with the baptism. The\nvery delay, so painful to them, is the best answer to their petitions.\nAs they endeavor to wait trustingly for the Lord to work they are\nled to exercise faith, hope, and patience, which have been too little\nexercised during their religious experience. Yet for the elect’s sake\nthe time of trouble will be shortened....\nThough a general decree has fixed the time when commandment\nkeepers may be put to death, their enemies will in some cases an-\nticipate the decree, and before the time specified, will endeavor to\ntake their lives.

Others are defended by angels in the form of\nmen of war.\nIn all ages, God has wrought through holy angels for the succor\nand deliverance of His people. Celestial beings have taken an active\npart in the affairs of men. They have appeared clothed in garments\nthat shone as the lightning; they have come as men in the garb of\nwayfarers. Angels have appeared in human form to men of God.\nThey have rested, as if weary, under the oaks at noon. They have\nLordWillComeMoreQuicklyThanManyExpect,December14 733\naccepted the hospitalities of human homes. They have acted as\nguides to benighted travelers. They have, with their own hands,\nkindled the fires at the altar. They have opened prison doors and set\nfree the servants of the Lord. Clothed with the panoply of heaven,\nthey came to roll away the stone from the Saviour’s tomb.\nIn the form of men, angels are often in the assemblies of the\nrighteous; and they visit the assemblies of the wicked, as they went\nto Sodom, to make a record of their deeds, to determine whether\nthey have passed the boundary of God’s forbearance. The Lord\ndelights in mercy; and for the sake of a few who really serve Him,\nHe restrains calamities and prolongs the tranquility of multitudes.\nLittle do sinners against God realize that they are indebted for their\nown lives to the faithful few whom they delight to ridicule and\noppress....

He must be a temple for the indwelling Spirit of God. In order\nto fulfill his mission, he must have a sound physical constitution,\nand mental and spiritual strength. Therefore it would be necessary\nfor him to control the appetites and passions. He must be able so to\ncontrol all his powers that he could stand among men as unmoved\nby surrounding circumstances as the rocks and mountains of the\nwilderness.\nIn the time of John the Baptist, greed for riches, and the love\nof luxury and display had become widespread. Sensuous pleasures,\nfeasting anddrinking, were causing physicaldisease anddegeneracy,\nbenumbing the spiritual perceptions, and lessening the sensibility\nto sin. John was to stand as a reformer.

The world is given\nto self-indulgence. Errors and fables abound. Satan’s snares for\ndestroying souls are multiplied.

This self-discipline is essential to that mental\nstrength and spiritual insight which will enable us to understand\nand to practice the sacred truths of God’s Word. For this reason\ntemperance finds its place in the work of preparation for Christ’s\nsecond coming (The Desire of Ages, 100, 101)."

And\nevery man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as\nhe is pure. 1 John 3:2, 3.\nThrough personal effort joined with the prayer of faith, the soul\nis trained. Day by day the charactergrows into the likeness ofChrist;\nand finally, instead of being the sport of circumstances, instead of\nindulging selfishness and being carried away by light and trifling\nconversation, the man is master of his thoughts and words. It may\ncost a severe conflict to overcome habits which have been long\nindulged, but we may triumph through the grace of Christ. He\ninvites us to learn of Him. He would have us practice self-control,\nand be perfect in character, working that which is well pleasing in\nHis sight. “By their fruits ye shall know them” is His own standard\nof judging character.\nIf we are true to the promptings of the Spirit of God, we shall\ngo on from grace to grace, and from glory to glory, until we shall\nreceive the finishing touch of immortality.\n“Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear\nwhat we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we\nshall be like him; for we shall see him as he is”.... Can any earthly\npromotion confer honor equal to this—to be sons of God, children\nof the heavenly King, members of the royal family? Man may be\nambitiousofthehonorthathisfinitefellowmancanbestow; butwhat\nwill it avail? The nobility of earth are but men; they die, and return\nto dust; and there is no lasting satisfaction in their praise and honor.\nBut the honor that comes from God is lasting. To be heirs of God\nand joint-heirs with Christ, is to be entitled to unsearchable riches—\ntreasures of such value that in comparison with them the gold and\nsilver, the gems andprecious stones ofearth, sinkinto insignificance.\n760"

But could\ntheir eyes be opened, ... they would see the angels of God encamped\nabout them, by their brightness and glory holding in check the hosts\nof darkness.\nAs the people of God afflict their souls before Him, pleading\nfor purity of heart, the command is given, “Take away the filthy\ngarments” from them, and the encouraging words are spoken, “Be-\nhold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe\nthee with change of raiment” (Zechariah 3:4). The spotless robe of\nChrist’s righteousness is placed upon the tried, tempted, yet faith-\nful children of God. The despised remnant are clothed in glorious\napparel, nevermore to be defiled by the corruptions of the world.\nTheir names are retained in the Lamb’s book of life, enrolled among\nthe faithful of all ages. They have resisted the wiles of the deceiver;\nthey have not been turned from their loyalty by the dragon’s roar.\nNow they are eternally secure from the tempter’s devices. Their sins\nare transferred to the originator of sin. And the remnant are not only\npardoned and accepted, but honored. “A fair miter” is set upon their\nheads. They are to be as kings and priests unto God. While Satan\nwas urging his accusations and seeking to destroy this company,\nholy angels, unseen, were passing to and fro, placing upon them the\nseal of the living God. These are they that stand upon Mount Zion\nwith the Lamb, having the Father’s name written in their foreheads.\nThey sing the new song before the throne, that song which no man\ncan learn save the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were\nredeemed from the earth. “These are they which follow the Lamb\nwhithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men,\n762"

Ephesians 1:9, 10, NIV.\nAs we near the close of this world’s history, the prophecies\nrelating to the last days especially demand our study. The last book\nof the New Testament scriptures is full of truth that we need to\nunderstand. Satan has blinded the minds of many, so that they have\nbeen glad of any excuse for not making the Revelation their study.\nBut Christ through His servant John has here declared what shall be\nin the last days, and He says, “Blessed is he that readeth, and they\nthat hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which\nare written therein.”\n“This is life eternal,” Christ said, “that they might know thee the\nonly true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” Why is it\nthat we do not realize the value of this knowledge?

The study of the incarnation of Christ,\nHis atoning sacrifice and mediatorial work, will employ the mind of\nthe diligent student as long as time shall last; and looking to heaven\nwith its unnumbered years he will exclaim, “Great is the mystery of\ngodliness.”\nIn eternity we shall learn that which, had we received the en-\nlightenment it was possible to obtain here, would have opened our\nunderstanding. The themes of redemption will employ the hearts\nand minds and tongues of the redeemed through the everlasting ages.\nThey will understand the truths which Christ longed to open to His\ndisciples, but which they did not have faith to grasp.
