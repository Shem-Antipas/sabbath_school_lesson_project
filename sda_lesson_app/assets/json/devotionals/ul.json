Hebrews 11:16.\nI wish you a happy new year. The old year with its burden of\nrecord has passed into eternity. Now let every thought, every feeling\nbe that of remembrance of God’s love. Let us gather up one token\nafter another....\nThe evidence we have of God’s care and love for us is expressed\nin the lessons Christgave to His disciples upon the things in nature....\nThe eye is not to be fastened upon deformity, upon the curse, but\nupon the riches of the grace of Christ that has been provided so\nabundantly, that we may live in this world, and act our part in the\ngreat web of humanity, and yet not be of the world. As pilgrims,\nas strangers looking for the bright things of God, the joy that is\nset before us, seeking a city whose builder and maker is God, and\nby beholding the provisions made for us, the mansions Jesus has\ngone to prepare for us, talking of the blessed home, we forget the\nannoyances and the fretting cares of this life. We seem to breathe in\nthe very atmosphere of that better, even the heavenly country. We\nare soothed, we are comforted; we are more than this, we are joyful\nin God.\nWe could not know the gracious purposes of God toward us, but\nfor the promises, for it is from them alone we learn what He has\nprepared for those who love Him. As the flowers in God’s wise\neconomy are constantly drawing the properties from earth and air to\ndevelop into the pure and beautiful buds and flowers and give forth\ntheir fragrance to delight the senses, so shall it be with us.\nWe draw from God’s promises all that peace, that comfort, that\nhope that will develop in us the fruits of peace, joy, and faith. And\nby bringing these promises into our own life we bring them always\ninto the lives of others. Then let us appropriate these promises to\nLookHeavenward,January1 29\nourselves.... They are like the precious flowers in the garden of God.\nThey are to awaken our hope and expectation, and lead us to a firm\nfaith and reliance upon God. They are to strengthen us in trouble\nand teach us precious lessons of trust in God. He in these precious\npromises draws back from eternity and gives us a glimpse of the far\nmore exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Let us then be quiet in\nGod. Let us calmly trust in Him and praise Him that He has shown\nus such revelations of His will and purposes that we shall not build\nour hopes in this life but keep the eye upward to the inheritance\nof light and see and sense the amazing love of Jesus.—Letter 27,"

        "content": "But now being made free from sin, and become servants to\nGod, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting\nlife. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal\nlife through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 6:22, 23.\nPaul felt that the Lord’s requirements must be obeyed, His judg-\nments avoided. Like Paul, we must make every effort to obtain the\ncrown of life, which brings eternal honor to every victor. We must\nnot be content to live useless lives.\nWhat is humility? That sense of sin and unworthiness which\nleads to repentance. But we must be assured of the malignity of\na disease before we feel our need of a cure. Those who do not\nrealize the sinfulness of sin are not able to appreciate the value of\nthe atonement and the necessity of being cleansed from all sin. The\nsinner measures himself by himself and by those who like himself\nare sinners. He does not look at the purity and holiness of Christ.\nBut when the law of God brings conviction to his heart, he says with\nPaul, “I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment\ncame, sin revived, and I died” (Romans 7:9)....\nGod created man for His glory. He will not, cannot endure the\npresence of sin in His dominion. If there are in the church those who\nare willfully sinning against God, every possible means should be\nused to bring them to repentance. If this is not done, God’s name is\ndishonored. He is too pure to look upon iniquity with favor....\nAdam’s sin would be regarded by the churches of today as a\nsimple mistake, to be at once forgiven and no more thought of. But\nGod’s standard is high and His word immutable, and all selfish,\ncovetous practices are an abomination in His sight. The hearts of\nbelievers need to be purified, sanctified, refined, ennobled....\nLook up, my brethren. Has the gospel lost its power to impress\nhearts? Is it because the regenerating influence of the Spirit of Christ\nhasdiedawaythatheartsarenotpurified, sanctified, andpreparedfor\nNeedforaReformation,January2 31\nthe Holy Spirit? No; the Sword of the Spirit, the Word of the living\nGod, is with us yet; but it must be wielded with earnestness. Let us\nuse it as did God’s sanctified ones of old. By its living, quickening\npower it will cut its way to hearts....\nThe Lord calls for a reformation all through our ranks.... When\nthe church is awakened, decided changes will be made. Men and\nwomen will be converted, and so filled will they be by the Spirit of\nGod that they will pass from country to country, from city to city,\nproclaiming the message of truth. With hearts filled with earnest\nlove for souls, they will open their Bibles and present the Word.—\nFor whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this\nis the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. 1 John\n5:4.\nWe need to draw near to our Helper, the One who is infinite in\nwisdom. He is our Minister and our great Medical Missionary, and\nHe knows the straits through which His believers on this earth will\npass.... He has been tempted in all points like as we are tempted. Let\nus not forget that Christ had the tempter to meet in every form, and\nthat when He met him, He, our Saviour, was bearing the likeness\nof humanity. He is our Restorer, the Perfecter of His covenant with\nthe human agencies who depend upon Him as their Prince and their\nRedeemer.\nChrist conquered as the sinless, unfallen, perfect Man. As the\nMessiah He has won the victory over the temptations of the enemy,\nmaking it possible for us to overcome as He overcame. We are to\novercome in every encounter with the enemy. We are to be victors\nby becoming partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the\ncorruption that is in the world through lust. Each victory that He\ngained in His humanity makes it possible for us, through receiving\nand believing in Him, to gain the victory. “As many as received him,\nto them gave he power to become the sons of God” (John 1:12).\nEach victory that He gained in humanity secures for us its genuine\nfruits. Each assault of Satan overcome marks the occasion of a\nvictory for humanity....\nThe deliverance of the people of God and His mercies to them in\npast trials are to be called to mind as an assurance of that which, if\nwe trust in God, He will do for us in present and future emergencies.\nWhatever may have been their experience, if they will surrender\nto God with full purpose of heart, with humility and contrition,\nHe will receive them. To all who by faith receive Christ as their\npersonal Saviour, He will give power to become overcomers—sons\nVictorsThroughChrist,January3 33\nand daughters of God. They become partakers of the divine nature,\nand fully realize His mercy and the grace of His Holy Spirit....\nLet our prayers ascend to God in all humility. Let us through\nthe grace Christ came to the world to impart confess and forsake\nour sins, with humble, contrite hearts. The Lord understands, for\nall secret things are known to Him. Not one mean action can be\nperformed without God understanding every phase of temptation....\nThroughout the gospels, Christ made frequent reference to the\ngreatconflictthatHe had withSatan atthe beginning ofHis ministry.\nHe makes constant reference to Satan’s kingdom as opposed to the\nkingdom of God. Let us be sure that we are on the Lord’s side,—"

How tender and considerate were His dealings with all.\nHe longed to break the spell of infatuation upon those who were\ndeceived and deluded by satanic agencies. He longed to give the\nsin-polluted soul pardon and peace.\nChrist was the mighty Healer of all spiritual and physical mal-\nadies. Look, O look, upon the sympathetic Redeemer. With the eye\nof faith behold Him walking in the streets of the cities, gathering the\nweak and weary to Himself. Helpless, sinful human beings crowd\nabout Him. See the mothers with their sick and dying little ones\nin their arms pressing through the crowd that they may get within\nreach of His notice and touch. Let the eye of faith take in the scene.\nWatch these mothers pressing their way to Him, pale, weary, almost\ndespairing, yet determined and persevering, bearing their burden of\nsuffering in their arms.\nAs these anxious ones are being crowded back, Christ makes\nHis way to them step by step, until He is close by their side. Tears\nof gladness and hope fall freely as they catch His attention and look\ninto the eyes expressing such tender pity and love for the weary\nmother as well as for her suffering child. He invites her confidence,\nsaying, “What shall I do for you?” She sobs out her great want—\n“Master, that Thou shouldest heal my child.” She has shown her\nfaith in urging her way to Him, though she did not know that He was\nmaking His way to her, and Christ takes the child from her arms.\nHe speaks the word, and disease flees at His touch. The pallor of\ndeath is gone. The life-giving current flows through the veins. The\nmuscles receive strength.\nWords of comfort and peace are spoken to the mother, and then\nanother case just as urgent is presented. The mother asks help for\nChrist,theMightyHealer,January12 51\nherself and her children, for they are all sufferers. With willingness\nand joy Christ exercises His life-giving power, and they give praise\nand honor and glory to His name who doeth wonderful things.\nNo frown on Christ’s countenance spurned the humble suppliant\nfrom His presence. The priests and rulers sought to discourage\nthe suffering and needy, saying that Christ healed the sick by the\npower of the devil. But His way could not be hedged up. He was\ndetermined not to fail or become discouraged.

It will exercise a power over the\nlife and conduct until the whole being is assimilated to the image\nof the Perfect Pattern, and the human agent is complete in Jesus\nChrist. “As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so\nwalk ye in him: rooted and built up,” not in self, not after men’s\nideas, but “in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught,\nabounding therein with thanksgiving. Beware lest any man spoil\nyou through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men,\nafter the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ” (Colossians\n2:6-8).\nYour greatest danger will be that you will not see the need of\ncontemplating the character of Christ with a set purpose to imitate\nHis life and conform your character to His character. You are to\nshow a marked difference between your character and that of the\nworld. “For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.\nAnd ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and\npower” (Colossians 2:9, 10).\nThe grand truths of the Bible are for us individually, to rule, to\nguide, to control our life, for this is the only way in which Christ\ncan be properly represented to our world in grace and loveliness in\nthe characters of all who profess to be His disciples. Nothing less\nthan heart service will be acceptable with God. God requires the\nsanctification of the entire man, body, soul, and spirit. The Holy\nSpirit implants a new nature, and molds through the grace of Christ\nthe human character, until the image of Christ is perfected.

Let not the youth hear you\nfinding fault with those who do not please your fancy. The youth are\nChrist’s servants, to be cared for, to be encouraged in good, pure,\nholy thoughts.

They are not to invest money merely for the\ngratification of selfish desires, for whatever is spent in this way is\njust that much kept from the Lord’s treasury. Through the sovereign\ngoodness of God, the Holy Spirit works through the human agent,\nConsecratedMoney,January15 57\nand causes him to make smaller or larger investments in the cause\nof God, to make them redound to the glory of God.\nWhenever you think of using the Lord’s money for your own\nselfish gratification, remember that there are many who are in deep\npoverty who cannot purchase either food or clothing, and [that] they\nare God’s heritage. We are to do good to all men, and especially to\nthose who are of the household of faith.

The things hard to be understood will\nthen find an explanation. The mysteries of grace will unfold before\nus. Where our finite minds discovered only confusion and broken\npurposes, we shall see the most perfect and beautiful harmony. We\nshall know that infinite love ordered the experiences that seemed\nmost trying and hard to bear. As we realize the tender care of Him\nwho makes all things work together for our good, we shall rejoice\nwith joy unspeakable and full of glory.\nPain cannot exist in the atmosphere of heaven.

There is a very earnest, solemn question before\nus. The time has come when every soul should understand that he\nhas a soul to save or a soul to lose, a heaven to win and a hell to\nshun. We need to understand what we shall do to be saved....\nIn the experience of God’s people there have been yokes ... that\nGod never ordained, yokes that have greatly marred the experience\nand have offended the Lord God of Israel. Because a man carries\nresponsibilities in the church, he is not given liberty to rule the mind\nand judgment of others with whom the Lord is working.

He lived with his parents at\nNazareth, and worked with Joseph at the carpenter’s trade. His life\nwas simple, free from any extravagance or display. When the time\ncame for His public work to begin, He went forth proclaiming the\ngospel of the kingdom. To the close of His work, He preserved\nsimplicity of habit. He chose His helpers from the lower ranks\nof life. His first disciples were humble fishermen of Galilee. His\nteaching was so simple that little children understood Him, and\nafterward might be heard repeating His words. All that He said and\ndid possessed the charm of simplicity.\nChrist was a close observer, noticing many things that others\npassed by. He was ever helpful, ever ready to speak words of hope\nand sympathy to the discouraged and the bereaved. He allowed the\ncrowd to press round Him, and complained not, though sometimes\nalmost lifted off His feet. When He met a funeral, He did not pass\nby indifferently. Sadness came over His face as He looked upon\ndeath, and He wept with the mourners.\nAs the children gathered the wildflowers growing so abundantly\naround them, and crowded up to present to Him their little offerings,\nHe received them gladly, smiled upon them, and expressed His joy\nat seeing so many varieties of flowers.\nThese children were His heritage. He knew that He had come to\nransom them from the enemy by dying on the cross of Calvary. He\nspoke words to them that ever after they carried in their hearts. They\nwere delighted to think that He appreciated their gifts and spoke so\nlovingly to them.\nChrist watched children at their play, and often expressed His\napproval when they gained an innocent victory over something they\nChrist’sLifeTouchedPeople,February12 115\nwere determined to do. He sang to children in sweet and blessed\nwords. They knew that He loved them. He never frowned on them.\nHe shared their childish joys and sorrows. Often He would gather\nflowers, and after pointing out their beauties to the children, would\nleave them with them as a gift. He had made the flowers and He\ndelighted to point out their beauties.\nIt has been said that Jesus never smiled. This is not correct. A\nchild in its innocence and purity called forth from His lips joyous\nThe fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth\nsouls is wise.

Now, just now, is\nthe time to obey the commission, “Teaching them to observe all\nthings whatsoever I have commanded you” (Matthew 28:20). Those\nwho do this work must have a ready knowledge of the Scriptures.\n“It is written” is to be their weapon of defense.\nGod has given us light on His Word that we may give it to our\nfellow men. The truth spoken by Christ will reach hearts. A “Thus\nsaiththeLord”willfallupontheearwithpower, andfruitwillappear\nwherever honest service is done.\nThe Lord calls for action.... Should we neglect to take advantage\nof this time, we should miss a great opportunity for letting light from\nGod’s Word shine forth. The trumpet is to give a certain sound.\nSay to the people: “Know foryourselves of the doctrine.” Let not\nyour lips utter a sentence of doubt. Do not come before the people\nwith an uncertain sound. Know what is truth and proclaim truth.\nChrist’s teaching was always positive in its nature. Never, never\nutter sentiments of doubt. Bear with a certain voice an affirmative\nmessage. Lift Him up, the Man of Calvary, higher and still higher.\nThere is power in the exaltation of the cross of Christ.\nChrist’s divinity is to be steadfastly maintained. When the\nSaviour asked His disciples the question, “Whom say ye that I am?”\nPeter answered, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God”\n(Matthew 16:15, 16). Said Christ, “Upon this rock,” not on Peter,\nbut on the Son of God, “I will build my church; and the gates of hell\nshall not prevail against it” (Verse 18).\nLaborersNeededfortheHarvest,February13 117\nGreat is the mystery of godliness.

Psalm\n50:23.\n[God] desires us to appreciate the great plan of redemption, to\nrealize our high privilege as the people of God, and to walk before\nHim in obedience, with grateful thanksgiving. He desires us to serve\nHim in newness of life, with gladness every day. He longs to see\ngratitude welling up in our hearts because we have access to the\nmercy seat, the throne of grace; because our names are written in\nthe Lamb’s book of life; because we may cast all our care on Him\nwho cares for us. He bids us rejoice because we are the heritage\nof the Lord, because the righteousness of Christ is the robe of His\nsaints, because we have the blessed hope of the soon coming of our\nSaviour.\nTo praise God in fullness and sincerity of heart is as much a duty\nas is prayer. We are to show to all the heavenly intelligences that we\nappreciate the wonderful love of God for fallen humanity, and that\nwe are expecting larger and yet larger blessings from His infinite\nfullness. Far more than we do, we need to speak of the precious\nchapters in our experience. After a special outpouring of the Holy\nSpirit, our joy in the Lord and our efficiency in His service will be\ngreatly increased by recounting His goodness and His wonderful\nworks in behalf of His children.\nSuch a testimony will have an influence upon others. No more\neffective means can we employ for winning souls to Christ. And\nour love is to be shown, not only in words, but in deeds, in personal\nministry and sacrifice. Christ says, “Not every one that saith unto\nme, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that\ndoeth the will of my Father which is in heaven” (Matthew 7:21).\nRecountGod’sGoodness,February16 123\nIn His prayer to His Father, He said of His disciples, “As thou\nhast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the\nworld” (John 17:18)....\nAnd by the Holy Spirit through the apostle Peter, we are admon-\nished, “As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the\nsame one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God”\n(1 Peter 4:10).\nThus it is that God desires to fulfill for us His purpose of grace.\nBy the power of His love, through obedience, fallen man, a worm of\nthe dust, is to be transformed, fitted to be a member of the heavenly\nfamily, a companion through eternal ages of God and Christ and the\nholy angels.

And when\nthere is a living connection with a living God, Christ abides in the\nheart by living faith, and the human agent works after Christ’s life.\nHe is going to change our life and character, speaking the words\nthat Christ speaks, revealing the character that Christ reveals. And\nif trials come to us, we will not manifest a rebellious spirit. The\nopportunities will present themselves to every one of us, because\nwe see oppression and unkindness, and because we see burdens that\nwould be thrown upon us, and let self come in and exhibit itself.\nWe letselfarise. We wantto putthe trials in theirrightplace, and\nwhere is it? Christ says to everyone that is weary and heavy laden,\n“Come unto me.” And what? “Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly\nin heart.” And notwithstanding the crush of conflict that we shall\nhave to pass through if we accept the truth of heavenly origin, there\nis meekness and lowliness in every move. Hide in Jesus Christ. Our\nlife and character is hid with Christ in God, so we cannot afford to\nlet any impulse of passion control our words or control our actions,\nbut we must keep the Saviour’s example ever before us, and we must\ndo just as Jesus would have done under similar circumstances. We\nare not to be revengeful.\nNow the work that is before us we want clearly to understand. It\nis a work of mercy, a work of love, a work just in Christ’s lines. Just\nas Christ worked. He says that the nobleman went a long journey,\nand to every man he gave his work. The human agent is to cooperate\nwith the divine. To everyone his work, and this is Christ’s work. It\nis not the man’s work. He is not to feel that all he has to do is to\nattend to his own individual self. No, there is a broader field. He\nis to occupy “till I come,” and what is it to occupy? To be laborers\nLivingConnectionWiththeLivingGod,February17 125\ntogether with God. Therefore, it is of the greatest consequence that\nwe understand in clear lines what it is to be laborers together with\nGod.\nWe must be imbued with the Spirit of Christ. We cannot labor\nwith God merely from our intellect or our education. We cannot\nbuy the grace of God with money; we cannot buy it with eloquence;\nwe cannot buy it with the power of our intellect.

Their unity and harmony is the convincing\nargument. Satan is therefore constantly at work to prevent this\nharmony and union, that in witnessing the bickerings, strifes, and\ndissension, unbelievers shall become disgusted with Christianity,\nand fastened in unbelief and infidelity. God is dishonored by those\nwho profess the truth while they are at variance with one another.\nIf our profession ... [to have] greater truths than other denomi-\nnations [have] does not lead to deeper consecration, and purer and\nholier lives, of what advantage is this truth to us?

We need to\ntake warning from the lesson of the pretentious fig tree that bore no\nfruit. It represents those who profess to serve God, whose names are\non the church books, but who bear no fruit in their lives to the glory\nof God. My heart is longing to see the Man, who was despised and\nrejected, crowned and seated upon His throne....\nThrough the agency of the Holy Spirit, God works a moral\nchange in the lives of His people, changing them into the likeness of\nChrist.

        "content": "In Luke we read of Christ, “It came to pass in those days, that he\nwent out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer\nto God” (chap. 6:12). Men of the world often spend whole nights\nplanning, in order to secure success; and Jesus spent many nights\nin prayer. He was alone with His Father, earnestly seeking the Lord\nwithstrong crying andtears. He seemedto be in an agonyofdistress.\nWhy was this? He had come to His vineyard to claim His own, but\nHe was rejected, abused. They [His enemies] were then laying\nplans to crucify Him. He was more and more ... beset by satanic\nagencies. The resistance shown by the priests and rulers to His work\ncorresponded to the convincing evidences of His divinity. They were\njealous of Him because He possessed a power that drew the people\nto Him. His tongue was like the pen of a ready writer. He was the\nvery treasure house of knowledge, and His parables and illustrations\nmade the truth plain to the unlearned. Under His teaching those who\ncould not learn the truth from books could learn it from nature.\nBut those who had been entrusted with the oracles of God, that\nthey might be faithful expositors of the Scriptures, rejected and\ndenied the Teacher sent from heaven. Christ saw that their spirit\nand principles were entirely contrary to the Scriptures. He saw\nthat the Word of God was misinterpreted and misapplied. He saw\nhow difficult it would be to instruct the people to read the Scriptures\ncorrectly, whentheirteachersreadthem inthelightoftheirperverted\njudgment. What could He do to soften and subdue their hearts? This\nwas the burden of His prayer.\nThe Jewish people might have repented, if they would, but they\nwere clothed with the garments of their own self-righteousness.\nThey claimed to be the descendants of Abraham, and looked upon\nPrayer—TheSecretofPower,March7 163\nevery promise made to Israel as theirs. But the Israel of God are\nthose who are converted, not those who are the lineal descendants\nof Abraham. “What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is\nthere of circumcision? Much every way: chiefly, because that unto\nthem were committed the oracles of God” (Romans 3:1, 2). “For he\nis not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision,\nwhich is outward in the flesh: but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly;\nand circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the\nletter; whose praise is not of men, but of God” (chap. 2:28, 29).—\n[81] Make God First, Last, and Best in Everything,\nLet a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and\nstewards of the mysteries of God. Moreover it is required in\nstewards, that a man be found faithful. 1 Corinthians 4:1, 2.\nThose who act a part in the work of God do good only because\nGod is behind them, doing the work. Shall we then praise men, and\ngive thanks to man, neglecting to recognize God? If we do, God will\nnot cooperate with us. When man puts himself first and God second,\nhe shows that he is losing his wisdom and righteousness. All that is\never done toward restoring the moral image of God in man is done\nbecause God is the efficiency of the worker. Christ declares in His\nprayer to His Father, “This is life eternal, that they might know thee\nthe only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent” (John\n17:3).\nLet every steward understand that as he strives to advance the\nglory of God in our world, whether he stands before infidels or\nprinces, he is to make God first and last and best in everything. The\ntrue Christian will realize that he has a right to his name only as he\nuplifts Christ with a steady, persevering, and ever-increasing force....\n“It is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful” (1\nCorinthians 4:2). When we are faithful in making God known, our\nimpulses will be under divine supervision, and we shall make steady\ngrowth, spiritually and intellectually. But when men enter into a\nconfederacy to exalt men, and have little to say of God, they are\nweakness itself. God will leave those who do not recognize Him\nin every effort made to uplift humanity. It is Christ’s power alone\nthat can restore broken-down human machinery. Everywhere and\nin every place let those around you see that you give God the glory.\nLet man be put in the shade, let God appear as the only hope of the\nhuman race. Every man must rivet his building to the eternal Rock,\nChrist Jesus; then it will stand amid storm and tempest.\nMakeGodFirst,Last,andBestinEverything,March8 165\nGod prepares the mind to recognize Him who alone can help\nthe striving, struggling soul. He will educate all who stand under\nHis banner to be faithful stewards of His grace. Man cannot show\ngreater weakness than by thinking he will find more acceptance in\nthe sight of men if he leaves God out of his assemblies. God must\nstand the highest. The wisdom of the greatest man is foolishness\nwith Him.\nGodhasgiventomanimmortalprinciples, towhicheveryhuman\npower must one day bow. We have truth that has been given us in\ntrust.

The spirit of disaffection is running riot.\nThe inhabitants of the Noachian world were destroyed because,\nafter being granted a period of one hundred and twenty years in\nwhich to choose between the evil and the good, they deliberately\nchose to follow their own wicked ways. Because they did not avail\nthemselves of the opportunity God gave them to repent and turn to\nHim, they were destroyed by the flood.\nOnce again, before the great destruction of the world by fire,\nthere is granted a period of test and trial. Men are given opportunity\nTimeforAction,March15 179\nto show whether or not they will be loyal to God. Satan is seeking to\nlead men in positions of trust to seek the regeneration of the world\nby plans of their own devising. These men desire to be reformers,\nbut they fail because they do not work in Christ’s lines. Can they\nreform others, when they cannot reform themselves? ...\nAs God’s witnesses, we have a message to bear to all the world.\nThe Lord has many children who have never heard the truth for this\ntime.

In human\nflesh He lived the law of God, that He might condemn sin in the\nflesh, and bear witness to heavenly intelligences that the law was\nordained to life and to ensure the happiness, peace, and eternal good\nof all who obey....\nThis is the mystery of godliness, that One equal with the Father\nshould clothe His divinity with humanity, and laying aside all the\nglory of His office as Commander in heaven, [should] descend step\nafter step in the path of humiliation, enduring severe and still more\nsevere abasement.

The Majesty of heaven was led as\na lamb to the slaughter, and amid scoffing and jeers, ridicule and\nfalse accusation, He was nailed to the cross. The crowd, in whose\nhearts humanity seemed to be dead, sought to aggravate the cruel\nsufferings of the Son of God by their revilings. But as a sheep before\nHis shearers is dumb, so He opened not His mouth. He was giving\nHis life for the life of the world, that all who believed in Him should\nnot perish....\nWeMayOvercomeasChristOvercame,March17 183\nChrist bore the sins of the whole world.

Our God has pledged\nHis word by His own greatness and infinity that He will bestow\npardon and peace upon all who will come to Him in the name of\n[99] Our Christian Experience Must Be Animated,\nI counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou\nmayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be\nclothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear;\nand anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. As\nmany as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and\nrepent. Revelation 3:18, 19.\nOur conscience must be purged from dead works to serve the\nliving God. Sanctification means perfect love, perfect obedience,\nentire conformity to the will of God. If our lives are conformed to\nthe life of Christ through the sanctification of mind, soul, and body,\nour example will have a powerful influence on the world. We are not\nperfect, but it is our privilege to cut away from the entanglements of\nself and sin, and go on unto perfection....\nGreat possibilities, high and holy attainments, are placed within\nthe reach of all who have true faith. Shall we not anoint our eyes\nwitheyesalve, thatwe maydiscern the wondrous things here brought\nbefore us? Why do we not with persevering earnestness, work out\nthis prayer, advancing onward and upward, reaching the standard\nof holiness? We are laborers together with God, and we must work\nin harmony with one another and with God, “for it is God which\nworketh in ... [us] both to will and to do of his good pleasure.” ...\nThe Lord takes no pleasure in seeing us spiritually weak. “God,\nwho commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in\nour hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God\nin the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen\nvessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of\nus.” We have conflicts and trials to meet, but we need not fail or be\ndiscouraged....\nGod can only be honored when we who profess to believe in\nHim are conformed to His image. We are to represent to the world\nOurChristianExperienceMustBeAnimated,March26 201\nthe beauty of holiness, and we shall never enter the gates of the city\nof God until we perfect a Christlike character. If we, with trust in\nGod, strive for sanctification, we shall receive it. Then as witnesses\nforChrist, we are to make known what the grace of God has wrought\nin us.\nThe greatest disquietude we can have is uncertainty. The accep-\ntance of the blessings of God brings righteousness and peace. The\nfruit of righteousness is quietness and assurance forever. We must\nhave simplicity and Godlike sincerity. We must have that wisdom\nwhich cometh from above. Our Christian experience must be ani-\nmated by piety, and instinct with the divine life.—Manuscript 38,"

His last words\nwere spoken to impress the disciples with the thought that they held\nin trust the message of Heaven for the world. In obedience to the\nSaviour’s command, the disciples returned to Jerusalem, and there\nwaited for the promised outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Heavenly\nintelligences cooperated with them, and gave power to the message\nthat they bore. The Holy Spirit gave efficiency to their missionary\nefforts, and on one occasion three thousand were converted in a\nday. Paul, miraculously transformed from a bitter persecutor to a\nzealous believer, was added to the number of the disciples. To him\nwas entrusted in a special manner the work of giving the message to\nthe Gentiles.\nCommissionisOurs,March27 203\nTo John, banished to the Isle of Patmos for his faithfulness in\nwitnessing to Christ, there was given special light to the church.

There is a true science, the\nscience of eternal life. When Jesus came to our world, He might\nhave opened to the minds of men a vast storehouse of scientific\nknowledge. But He did not do this.

        "verse_ref": " John 12:24",
        "content": "In this age we can see the necessity of drawing men to Christ.\nThis draws them to one another in that confidence, that love, that\nunity, for which Christ prayed in His last prayer with and for His\ndisciples. This unity was essential for their spiritual growth. This\nworld is a battlefield, upon which the powers of good and evil are in\nceaseless warfare.\nAt the time when Christ’s work bore only the appearance of\ncruel defeat, when to the disciples the case seemed hopeless, certain\nGreeks came to the disciples, saying, “We would see Jesus” (John\n12:21). This inquiry showed Christ, who was then standing in the\nshadow of the cross, that the sacrificial offering of Himself would\nbring all who believe into perfect harmony with God. By making\nthis propitiation of man’s sins, Christ’s kingdom would be perfected\nand extended throughout the world. He would work as the Restorer.\nHis Spirit would prevail everywhere.\nNone of the people, not even the disciples, understood the nature\nof Christ’s kingdom. They seemed to be unable to believe that Jesus\nwould not sit on David’s throne, that He would not take the scepter,\nand reign as a temporal prince in Jerusalem, before His ancients\ngloriously....\nChrist heard the eager, hungering cry, “We would see Jesus.”\nThese Greeks represented the nations and tribes and peoples who\nwould awake to their great need of a power out of and above finite\npower. For a moment Christ looked into futurity, and heard voices\nproclaiming in all places of the earth, “Behold the Lamb of God,\nwhich taketh away the sin of the world” (chap. 1:29). This antici-\npation, the consummation of His hopes, is expressed in His words,\n“The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified” (chap.\nHarvestoftheCross,April6 225\n12:23). But the way and manner that this glorifying was to take\nplace was never absent from Christ’s mind. Only by His death could\nthe world be saved. As the grain of wheat, the Son of man must be\ncast into the earth, and die, and be buried out of sight; but He was to\nlive again!\n[In] every harvest this lesson of the grain of wheat is repeated.\nThose who till the soil have the illustration of Christ’s words ever\nbefore them. The seed buried in the ground produces much fruit,\nand in their turn the seeds of this fruit are planted. Thus the harvest\nis multiplied. The harvest of the cross of Calvary will bear fruit unto\neternal life. And the contemplation of this will be the glory of those\nwho will live through eternal ages. With this lesson Christ connects\n“We Would See Jesus.”"

Paul in his Epistle to the Hebrews says, “For he\nendured, as seeing him who is invisible” (Hebrews 11:27). This\ncharacter of Moses does not simply mean passive resistance of evil,\nbut perseverance in a firm, consistent course. He kept the Lord ever\nbefore him, and the Lord was at his right hand to help him.\nMoses had a deep sense of the presence of God. He saw God. He\nwas not only looking down through the ages to a Christ that would\nbe revealed, but he saw Christ in a special manner accompanying\nthe children of Israel in all their travels. God was real to him and\npresent in his thoughts. When called upon to face danger, to bear\ninsult, and to be misunderstood for Christ’s sake, he was persevering\nto endure without retaliation.\nMoses believed in God as One whom he needed, and One who\nwould help him because he needed His help. God was to him a\npresent help in every time of need. We have far too much dead,\nnominal faith, but the real trusting, persevering faith we do not have.\nGod was to Moses a Rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.\nMoses had respect unto the recompense of the reward. Here is\nanother point in faith we wish to study, and if brought into the life\nand experience, it will enable everyone who fears and loves God\nto endure trials. God will reward the man of faith and obedience.\nMoses was full of confidence in God, because he had appropriating\nfaith. He needed the help of God, and he prayed for it, and believed\nfor it, and wove it into his life experience that God cared for him.\nHe believed that God ruled his life in particular. He knew that God\nSeeingtheInvisible,April7 227\nhad assigned to him a special work, and he would make that work\nthoroughly successful so far as possible. But he knew that he could\nnot do this without the help of God, for he had a perverse people\nto deal with. The presence of God, he knew, was strong enough\nto carry him through the most trying positions that a man could be\nplaced in. He could see and acknowledge God in every detail of his\nlife, that he was under the eye of an all-seeing God, who weighs\nmotives, who tries the hearts. He looked to God and believed in\nHim for strength to carry him through uncorrupted every form of\ntemptation.... This is the kind of faith we need, faith that will endure"

His\nholiness, His justice, His truth, shouldpurifyyourwords andactions.\nYou need to stop and consider that there is a God. He has spoken\ngood in your behalf, and He will be much displeased if you deal\nunjustly with His heritage. He calls upon you to turn to Him with\nfull purpose of heart. Pray, for your soul’s sake, pray; for you have\nbeen so many times self-deceived and led by deceptive influences\nthat you are tempted to regard with favor those who will flatter and\nextol you, and with disfavor those who would point out your errors\nand dangers.\nTurntoGodWhileThereisTime,April15 243\nMany times you have almost gone over to the wrong side, but\nbefore the throne has stood your Saviour, the prints of the nails in\nHis hands, interceding in your behalf. Pray for yourself, in the name\nof Christ. Pray earnestly, fervently, sincerely. I hope that your life\nmay be spared, and that you may give yourself wholly to repentance.\nCome to the Lord, and surrender all to Him. You must, or you will\nbe taken captive by the enemy.\nI can ... but write these words, for One [who is] of the highest\nDr. J. H. Kellogg, who was in danger of going off into pantheism."

He must associate closely with divine agencies, drawing by faith\nthe grace so much needed to resist the elements of unrighteousness.\nChrist saw Satan patterning after heaven by the use of human\nassociation, thus extending the contagion of evil, and He determined\nto make His church a resisting element. His people are not to borrow\nthe forms and customs of the world, but are to be instinct with the\nprinciples which make the church on earth a symbol of the church in\nheaven, a channel through which heaven’s rich blessings can flow.\nUntoldgoodmaybeaccomplishedbytherighteousworkingwith\nand for the wicked; but too often those who ought to lead sinners to\nGod do not draw with Christ.... Church members are under a solemn\npledge to form characters different in every way from the characters\nof worldlings. If a change does not take place in them prior to their\nunion with the church, there is danger that, though they have joined\nthe church, they will assimilate with worldlings. Satan triumphs\nwhen he sees the leaven of the world working in the church, to the\ndestruction of its purity and holiness.\nIt is God’s plan that in His church heavenly influences shall be\nreinforced and stimulated by the cooperation of the members with\nHim. His people are to increase in strength and efficiency, knowing\nDrawwithChrist,April19 251\nthat the atmosphere which surrounds the souls of righteous believers\nis the same as the atmosphere in the heaven of purity and light and\nlove. Through Christian fellowship they are to form their characters,\nassimilating them to the character of Christ. According to their faith\nwill be their Christlike meekness and lowliness. As God’s people\nseek to fulfill this plan, they are answering the prayer of Christ,\n“Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.”—Manuscript\nI commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is\nable to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all\nthem which are sanctified. Acts 20:32.\nWhat is genuine sanctification? Read Exodus 31. In that chap-\nter we shall understand the term, for God Himself has defined it.\nThe Lord Jesus had given the special directions how to build the\ntabernacle. As the children of Israel had been compelled to work\non the Sabbath, the sacredness of the day was not preserved. As\nslaves in Egypt, they had largely lost the knowledge of the Sabbath.\nThis is the reason the commandments of God were given in awful\ngrandeur upon Mount Sinai. The Lord would guard His Sabbath in\nparticular, and He knew the people would forget the commandment\nof the Sabbath, and in their zeal the workmen would say, “This\nwork is the Lord’s, and under His supervision, and we can do His\nwork without observing the Sabbath....” Therefore the seventh day\nwas distinguished as God’s memorial and was to be kept holy unto\nthe Lord that the people “may know that I am the Lord that doth\nsanctify” them. This is genuine sanctification....\nBut the work must needs go deeper, take firmer hold of the life\nand of the character. Some have thought they could easily persuade a\nsinner to give up his idols, to keep God’s commandments, to believe\nJesusissoontocomeinthecloudsofheaven. Whentheycanawaken\nno interest, no desire to search the Scriptures to see if these things\nare indeed truth; when they see no conviction assured in the minds\nof those who transgress the law of God; when they are frequently\nmet with flimsy excuses, with indifference or decided opposition\nand ridicule; when their hearers turn aside to heap contempt upon\nGod’s holy law, they become discouraged. Where they looked for\nsuccess, they found defeat....\nOh, how many lessons those young in the faith will have to learn\nin the exercise of winning souls to Christ! Some will learn in defeat\nTrueSanctification,April20 253\nand failure the lessons they would not otherwise have learned, but\na few repulses have so chilling an influence that the spark of grace\nalmost becomes extinct in their own souls and they think it does not\npay to make efforts to save souls, and they no longer shine as lights\nin the world. The thought of turning souls from the errors of their\nways, the sense of obligation to impart to others the precious light\nof truth, dies, and they do nothing....\nThese difficulties, opposition, disappointments and discourage-\nments they must meet again in a more decided, intense manner,\nbut they must be firm as a rock to principle.

One of the\ndisciples was sent to meet the chariot, and when he came to the\nplace, he saw the man studying the Scriptures. Philip said to him,\n“Understandest thou what thou readest?” He answered, “How can\nI, except some man should guide me?” Then Philip opened to him\nthe Scriptures. And when he had heard and believed, the Ethiopian\nasked, “What doth hinder me to be baptized?” (Acts 8:30, 31, 36).\nThis experience shows the Lord’s care for His people. It was\nthe Spirit of God that led this man’s mind to the Scriptures. But he\ncould not interpret their meaning. Then the Lord sent one of His\nservants to enlighten his mind, and to make him understand.\nWhen the Ethiopian asked, “What doth hinder me to be bap-\ntized?” Philip did not wait to see how he would hold on to the faith.\nHe said, “If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And\nhe answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.\nAnd he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down\nboth into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized\nhim” (Verses 37, 38).\nThe Lord wants everyone of us to fill the very place He has\nappointed us. If we will walk in simplicity and godliness, and trust\nin the Lord, just as the little child trusts its earthly parent, He will\nenable us to do the work He has given us to do. If we will seek the\nLord, He will work for us.... The Lord will work out our salvation\nfor us, if we will commit the keeping of our souls unto Him as unto\na faithful Creator....\nIt is not we who make the impression upon the mind and heart.\nAngels of God make the impression. They see every effort we\nFollowtheLord’sDirections,April26 265\nmake, and they soften the hearts and enlighten the minds of those for\nwhom we are working, so that heavenly impressions can be made,\nand hearts and minds can be led to see and understand....\nYou are not working alone.

But the heathen nations were not prepared for His work. And\nhad He devoted His time to the conversion of the Gentile world, He\nwould have closed the door whereby He could bear His message to\nthe Jewish nation....\nFrequently the people of other nations came to Christ to be\nhealed, or to make some request for their relatives or friends. These\npeople represented the great human family, who knew not God or\nthe truth, but who felt a soul-longing for something they had not.\nAll who came to Christ listened to His instruction, and as they heard\nthe word of truth, they were deeply impressed. In speaking words\nof hope to those weary, unsatisfied souls, in healing the infirmities\nof those who came to Him, Christ was setting an example to be\npracticed from one end of the world to another. He was speaking and\nacting for humanity at large.... Although generation after generation\nwould pass away, His lessons of practical service would be given by\nHis witnesses. He was to ascend to heaven, but His work was to be\ncarried forward with greater power than before, because He and His\nFather would cooperate in doing greater things for His people than\nthey had seen while He was among them.\nWe are to work while it is day, for the night cometh, in which no\nman can work. Our life is represented as a day, and when our work\nis ended, when the worker ceases his busy activity, the work does\nnot cease. Others take it up. Though the human agents pass away,\nthe work of Christ does not cease, but goes on, each worker doing\nGod service by working as Christ worked.\nChrist’sWorkandOurWork,May31 337\nWe often feel that in the work of God there are great interests\nto be handled that we are unable to touch. We seem bound about.\nLet us remember that Christ’s work while on earth was confined\nto a narrow compass. Yet multitudes from all parts of the world\nheard His lessons. He was giving His message to those who would\nafterwards become His disciples.\nChrist worked out before His disciples and the world a perfect\nexample of true religion.

His\nlanguage is adapted to the opening intellect of child life. The great\nTeacher brought His hearers in contact with nature, that they might\nlisten to the voice which speaks in all created things; and as their\nhearts became tender and their minds receptive, He helped them to\ninterpret the spiritual teaching of the scenes upon which their eyes\nrested. The parables, by means ofwhich He loved to teach lessons of\ntruth, show how open His spirit was to the influences of nature, and\nhow He delighted to gather spiritual teaching from the surroundings\nof daily life.\nThe birds of the air, the lilies of the field, the sower and the seed,\nthe shepherd and the sheep—with these Christ illustrated immortal\ntruth. He drew illustrations from the facts of life, facts of experience\nfamiliar to the hearers—the hid treasure, the pearl, the fishing net,\nthe lost coin, the prodigal son, the houses on the rock and on the\nsand. In His lessons there was something to interest every mind, to\nNature’sLessonBook,June2 343\nappeal to every heart. Thus the daily task, instead of being a mere\nround of toil, bereft of higher thoughts, was brightened and uplifted\nby constant reminders of the spiritual and the unseen.\nThe Lord Jesus would have the true philosophy of nature’s great\nlesson book opened before the mind....

To enable man to\nreach this standard, God sent into the world His only begotten Son.\nIn our behalf Christ made an infinite sacrifice. He laid aside His\nkingly crown and royal robe, clothed His divinity with humanity,\nand came into our world to teach men and women the laws of life\nand salvation, which they must carry out to the letter in order to have\neverlasting life in the kingdom of glory.\nSatan claimed that it was impossible for human beings to keep\nGod’s law. In order to prove the falsity of this claim, Christ left His\nhigh command, took upon Himself the nature of man, and came to\nthe earth to stand at the head of the fallen race, in order to show\nthat humanity could withstand the temptations of Satan. He became\nthe Head of humanity, to be assaulted with temptations on every\npoint as fallen human nature would be tempted, that He might know\nhow to succor all who are tempted. On this earth He worked out the\nproblem of how to live in accordance with God’s standard of right.\nBearing our nature, He was true to God’s standard of righteousness,\ngaining the victory over Satan. He was tempted in all points like as\nwe are, yet He was without sin.\nBefore Christ came in person to reveal His Father’s character,\nSatan thought that he would have the whole world on his side. And\ntoday the enemy is still playing the game of life with everyone. He\nseeks to bring in dissension and division. But if we are partakers\nof the divine nature, we will stand as a united whole. Let us not\nthink that our churches can enjoy God’s blessing while in a state of\ndisunion. In this world we are to be representatives of Christ. He\nhas called us to glory and virtue. As He represented the Father, so\nCalledtoGloryandVirtue,June7 353\nwe are to represent Him to the world, for in representing Him we\nare representing the Father, who is in every place to help where help\nis needed.\nWe have a great work to perform for the Master. After Jesus has\nsacrificed so much in our behalf, giving His life for our salvation,\nshall we by our course of action make Him ashamed of us? ... He\ndesires to see us rise to the highest standard. When by living faith\nwe lay hold of the power of a living Christ; when we plead His\nunfailing promises, and claim them as ours; when we seek for the\npower of the Holy Spirit, we are eating the flesh and drinking the\ngiven at the Petaluma, California, campground, “Lessons From the\nSecond Chapter of Peter.”"

        "content": "“I am the true vine,” Christ declared. He used the figure of\nthe vine that as we look upon it, we may call to remembrance His\nprecious lessons. Rightly interpreted, nature is the mirror of divinity.\nChrist pointed to the vine and its branches: I give you this\nlesson that you may understand My relationship to you and your\nrelationship to Me. There was not the least excuse for His hearers\nto misunderstand His words. The figure He used was as a mirror\nheld up before them, that they might understand His connection with\nthem.\nThis lesson will be repeated to the ends of the earth. All who\nreceive Christ by faith become one with Him. The branches are not\ntied to the vine by any mechanical process or artificial fastening.\nThey are united to the vine and have become part of it. They are\nnourished by the roots of the vine. So those who receive Christ by\nfaith become one with Him in principle and action. They are united\nto Him, and the life they live is the life of the Son of God. They\nderive their life from Him who is life....\nThe heart must be united with Christ’s heart, the will must be\nsubmerged in His will, the mind must become one with His mind,\nthe thoughts must be brought into captivity to Him. A man may be\nbaptized, and his name placed on the church rolls, yet the heart may\nbe unchanged. Hereditary and cultivated tendencies may still work\nevil in the character.\nThe regenerated man has a vital union with Christ. As the branch\nderivesitssustenancefromtheparentstock,andbecauseofthisbears\nmuch fruit, so the true believer is united with Christ, and reveals in\nhis life the fruits of the Spirit. The branch becomes one with the\nvine. Storm cannot carry it away. Frosts cannot destroy its vital\nAreYouaFruitfulBranch? June17 373\nproperties. Nothing is able to separate it from the vine. It is a living\nbranch, and it bears the fruit of the vine. So with the believer. By\ngood words and good actions, he reveals the character of Christ. As\nthe branch derives its nourishment from the vine, so all who are truly\nconverted draw spiritual vitality from Christ. “Verily, verily, I say\nunto you,” He declared, “Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man,\nand drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh,\nand drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at\nthe last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink\nindeed.

But\ninstead of moving farther away from us, He came and dwelt among\nus, filled with all the fullness of the Godhead, to be one with us,\nthat through His grace we might attain to perfection. By a death of\nshame and suffering He paid man’s ransom. What self-sacrificing\nlove is this! From the highest excellency He came, His divinity\nclothed with humanity, descending step by step to the very depths\nof humiliation. No line can measure the depth of this love. Christ\nhas shown us how much God can love and our Redeemer suffer in\norder to secure our complete restoration. He desires His children to\nreveal His character, to exert His influence, that other minds may be\ndrawn into harmony with His mind.\nChrist, our Saviour, in whom dwelt absolute perfection, became\nsin for the fallen race. He did not know sin by the experience of\nsinning, but He bore the terrible weight of the guilt of the whole\nworld. He became our propitiation, that all who receive Him may\nbecome sons of God. The cross was erected to save man. Christ\nlifted on the cross was the means devised in heaven for awakening\nin the repenting soul a sense of the sinfulness of sin. By the cross\nChrist sought to draw all to Himself. He died as the only hope\nof saving those who, because of sin, were in the gall of bitterness.\nThrough the agency of the Holy Spirit, a new principle of mental and\nspiritual power was to be brought to man, who, through association\nwith divinity, was to become one with God.\nTo break down the barriers that Satan had erected between God\nand man, Christ made a full and complete sacrifice, revealing unex-\nChrist’sLoveCannotBeMeasured,June26 391\nampled self-denial. He revealed to the world the amazing spectacle\nof God living in human flesh, and sacrificing Himself to save fallen\nman. What wonderful love!

He came to redeem\nsinners and clothe them with His righteousness. As the Saviour of\nthe world, He was subject to temptations. The enemy assailed Him\non every point. Constantly he came to Him with the suggestion that\nby compromising with the world, He might win the world. Christ is\nour example.... [Although] He was in the world, He was not of the\nworld. He was not to conform to worldly practices in order to reach\nthe object of His life. He was not to please Himself. The highest\nstandard must be maintained. Deviation from strict moral rectitude\nwould mar His whole lifework.\nIn order to save humanity, Christ came down to the level of\nhumanity, as far as worldly advantages were concerned. He came\nto this earth to be tempted in all points like as human beings are\ntempted. In the wilderness Satan came to Him and assailed Him on\nthe great points on which he assails man, but the Saviour did not\nyield to the enemy. Not in a single particular was He overcome. And\nthe temptations were just as real to Him as they are to us today.\nConstantly the Pharisees tried to lead Christ away from the prin-\nciples of God’s government. Making a great profession of piety,\nthey sought to lead Him to swerve from His allegiance. Satan has\npersuaded many men to deviate from principle by telling them that\nthe end will justify the means.

There are some who\nfollow false principles. Their idea of principle is misleading. Fol-\nlowing right principle means the faithful doing of the first four and\nthe last six commandments. In obedience to these divine commands,\nwe eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ, appropriating all that\nis embraced in the atonement made on Calvary. Christ will stand by\nthe side of all who receive Him as their Saviour. To them He will\ngive power to become the sons of God. “The Word was made flesh,\nand dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the\nonly begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth” (John 1:14).\nThe One here referred to as the Word is the Son of God, who\nwas the Commander in the heavenly courts, and who came to this\nworld to open heavenly things to fallen human beings. He is the\nWay, the Truth, and the Life. He is the Word that was with God\nbefore the world was. In clothing His divinity with humanity, He\nbecame possessed of two natures, the divine and the human. And\nbecause of this, He was fully able to accomplish for the human race\ntheir complete redemption, and their restoration to the privileges of\nthe higher life.\nHe began His earthly life as human beings begin theirs, coming\nto this world as a helpless babe. And while here, He lived the life\nthat every human being may live who will receive the great gift that\nthe Lord made to our world in sending His Son to work out the plan\nof salvation.\nChrist bore the penalty of sin, the stroke of divine justice, that\nhuman beings might not be left to perish.

This is the science ofsalvation,\nStandingbyPrinciple,July1 403\nwhich can safely be searched into, and which it is profitable to strive\nto understand....\nThose who continue in transgression will be judged according to\ntheir refusal of light. They choose to stand on the side of the prince\nof darkness, to become the helping hand of him who, if it were\npossible, would deceive the very elect. They refuse the wonderful\ngift of heaven, and though they may profess righteousness, and talk\nof “adherence to principle,” they are at the same time following\nprinciples opposed to the noble principles of heaven, and they teach\nothers to follow the same corrupting principles.—Manuscript 161,"

No one has any justification\nfor departing from Bible principles....\nHe who is sensitive to the admonitions of the Lord will work out\nhis own salvation with fear and trembling, knowing that it is God\nwho is working in him, to will and to do of His good pleasure. The\ntruth of God, abiding in the heart, brings the principles of the law of\nGod into daily practice.\nThe man who consents to be deceived is the man in whose\nheart the truth is not abiding. To be occasionally a Christian, to\nbe occasionally devout, is a great deception. It is living a lie. An\noccasional glance at the Word of God is not enough. An occasional\npetition to the throne of grace, a form of words, does not bring a\nsupply of grace for the soul’s need. In order for the truth of God\nto regulate the life, it must be implanted in the heart. It must be\nbrought into the inmost life.\nThe day will come when you will see that it does not pay to trifle\nwith the interests of your soul, allowing it to become diseased, so\ninefficient that Christ declares, “Thou art neither cold nor hot.... So\nthen because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spue\nthee out of my mouth” (Revelation 3:15, 16).

Through the grace of God, they are enabled\nto keep their purity of principle unsullied. Holy angels are close\nbeside them, and Christ is revealed in their steadfast adherence to\nthe truth. They are Christ’s minutemen, bearing, as true witnesses, a\ndecided testimony in favor of His truth. They show that there is a\nspiritual power that can enable men not to swerve an inch from truth\nand justice, for all the gifts men can bestow.

The true Chris-\ntian carefully cherishes the truth, realizing that it is more precious\nthan gold. He has an argument that is proof against all the assaults\nof the enemy.\nNothing but the truth of God can meet the needs of the soul.\nThis truth must be enshrined in the heart, becoming a part of the life.\nThus an experience is gained that makes the soul watchful, careful to\ndo nothing that would be out of harmony with the will of Him who\nChrist’sMinutemen,July19 439\ndied that men and women might have eternal life.

And why? “For ye are\nbought with a price,” and have enlisted under the banner of Prince\nEmmanuel. We are enlisted for labor, “not for the meat which\nperisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life”\n(John 6:27). We are to work out our own salvation with fear and\nwith trembling. We are not our own. We are bought with a price,\nto glorify God with our bodies and spirits, which are His. A work\nis to be done.

It means to be faithful\nworkers, to do all possible to win souls to Christ.

The Lord Jesus came in human\nnature to our world to give His precious life as an example of what\nour life should be. He is the specimen, not of spiritual indulgence,\nbut of a life constantly before us of self-denial, self-sacrifice. We\nhave the correct view that Christ our Pattern came to give us.

He was too much their friend to remain silent while they were\npursuing a course which would ruin their souls—the souls He had\npurchased with His own blood.

The Pharisees who had prompted the lawyer to ask\nthis question were expecting the Lord Jesus to answer it in such a\nway that they could find something against Him whereby they might\naccuse and condemn Him before the people. The self-possession of\nChrist, the wisdom and authority by which He spake, was something\nthey could not interpret.\nWhen this question was asked by the lawyer, Christ knew that\nthe suggestion came from His bitterest enemies, who were setting\na trap to catch Him in His words. The Lord Jesus responded to the\nquestion by placing the burden upon the lawyer to answer his own\nquestion before that crowd. “What is written in the law? how readest\nthou? And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God\nwith all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and\nwith all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.

The\nlaw of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. The answer to this\nquestion, as given by the lawyer, comprehends the entire duty of\nman, who is seeking eternal life. The lawyer was unable to evade\nthe question so directly and pointedly expressed as to the conditions\nof eternal life. He understood its bearings, and the necessity of\nanswering the demands of the law in loving God supremely, and his\nneighbor as himself. He knew he had not done either of these, and\nthe conviction of his neglect to obey the first four commandments\nObedienceisthePrice,July26 453\nand the last six commandments plainly specified in the words of\nthe holy oracles of God was impressed by the Holy Spirit upon his\nheart.

These\nrealized as fully then as we realize now the promise of the presence\nof God in their midst. Wherever Enoch found one or two who were\nwilling to hear the message he had for them, Jesus joined with them\nin their worship of God. In Enoch’s day there were some among the\nwicked inhabitants of earth who believed. The Lord never yet has\nleft His faithful few without His presence nor the world without a\nwitness.\nEnoch was a public teacher of the truth in the age in which he\nlived. He taught the truth; he lived the truth; and the character of the\nteacher who walked with God was in every way harmonious with the\ngreatness and sacredness of his mission. Enoch was a prophet who\nspake as he was moved by the Holy Ghost. He was a light amid the\nmoral darkness, a pattern man, a man who walked with God, being\nobedient to God’s law—that law which Satan had refused to obey,\nwhich Adam had transgressed, which Abel obeyed, and because of\nhis obedience was murdered. And now God would demonstrate to\nthe universe the falsity of Satan’s charge that man cannot keep God’s\nlaw. He would demonstrate that though man had sinned, he could\nso relate himself to God that he would have the mind and spirit of\nGod and would be a representative symbol of Christ. This holy man\nwas selected of God to denounce the wickedness of the world, and\nto evidence to the world that it is possible for men to keep all the\nlaw of God....\nEnoch not only meditated and prayed, and put on the armor of\nwatchfulness, but he came forth from his pleadings with God to\nplead with his fellow men.

Thus they were to show to a world that knew not God\nthat the Lord does not forsake those who trust in Him.

When we feel exceedingly tried, let us remember\nthat there is a heavenly angel by our side. This thought will help us\nto honor Christ, who has made it possible for us to become sons and\ndaughters ofGod. Unless we are constantly on ourguard, we may be\ncaught unawares, and speak hastily.

A pure, trusting faith, constantly ex-\nercised to understand what is truth which sanctifies the receiver, a\ncommitting of the keeping of the soul to God, under any and ev-\nery circumstance, as unto One whom they knew would not betray\ntheir trust. Our Creator will keep that which is committed unto Him\nagainst that day.\nChrist, by His sacrifice to save sinners, evidenced His great love\nfor the human soul. He gave His life to secure our salvation. What\nan insult so many, deceived by Satan’s temptations, offer to the\nSaviour by abusing their privileges, refusing to acknowledge His\nloving interest in them. Yet He, their Creator and Redeemer, bears\nlong with them in their persistent disdain of His mercies. As this\nmatter is daily urged upon my mind, I am so astonished that I cannot\nhold my peace. I long to reach sinners, and to cry out to them, “Turn\nye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die?” (Ezekiel\n33:11).\nChrist with His own blood has bought the whole human family.\nWe are His purchased possession.

An active, living faith distinguishes\nthe people of God from the sinful, who by their rejection of Christ\nbear continually to the world a plain testimony: “I will not have this\nman Christ Jesus to rule over me. I will not eat and drink to the\nglory of God, but will follow my inclination, eating and drinking\nas I please.

He bids the\nsaints to advance unitedly, going from strength to greater strength,\nfrom faith to increased assurance and confidence in the truth and\nrighteousness of His cause.\nLet us ever bear in mind that our work is to be one of advance-\nment. We are to follow on to know the Lord. God understands the\nactuating principles of every mind. He has witnessed the persistent,\nrebellious course of some whom He has warned and counseled re-\npeatedly. His all-seeing eye has noted the determined following of\nhuman devisings. The way of man is before the Lord. He knoweth\nthe thoughts. “The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding\nthe evil and the good” (Proverbs 15:3). He looketh to the ends of the\nearth, and He seeth under the whole heavens. The Lord searcheth\nthe hearts.\nWe are to stand firm as a rock to the principles of the Word\nof God, remembering that God is with us to give us strength to\nmeet each new experience. Let us ever maintain the principles of\nrighteousness in our lives, that we may go forward from strength\nto strength in the name of the Lord.

John 3:16.\nAfter the Saviour had fasted forty days and forty nights, “he was\nafterward an hungered.” Then it was that Satan appeared to Him.\nHe came as a beautiful angel from heaven, claiming that he had a\ncommission from God to declare the Saviour’s fast at an end. “If\nthou be the Son of God,” he said to Christ, “command that these\nstones be made bread” (Matthew 4:3). But in Satan’s insinuation of\ndistrust, Christ recognized the enemy whose power He had come to\nearth to resist. He would not accept the challenge, nor be moved by\nthe temptation. He stood firmly to the affirmative. “Man shall not\nlive by bread alone,” He said, “but by every word that proceedeth\nout of the mouth of God” (Verse 4).\nChrist stood by every word of God, and He prevailed. If we\nwould always take such a position as this when tempted, refusing to\ndally with temptation or argue with the enemy, the same experience\nwould be ours. It is when we stop to reason with the devil that we are\novercome. It is for us to know individually that we are right in the\nwarfare, to take the affirmative in the sightofGod, andthere to stand.\nIt is thus that we will obtain the divine power promised, through\nwhich we obtain “all things that pertain unto life and godliness,\nthrough the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue”\n(2 Peter 1:3).\nThere is such a thing as being partaker of the divine nature. We\nshall all be tempted in a variety of ways, but when we are tempted\nwe need to remember that a provision has been made whereby we\nmay overcome. ... He who truly believes in Christ is made partaker\nof the divine nature, and has power that he can appropriate under\nevery temptation. He will not fall under temptation or be left to\ndefeat....\nHeavenGaveItsMostCostlyTreasure,August29 523\nWe think it costs us something to stand in this position before the\nworld; and so it does. But what has our salvation cost the heavenly\nuniverse? To make us partakers of the divine nature, heaven gave\nits most costly treasure.... He engaged to stand in a fallen world as\nthe representative of the Father. And He would die in behalf of a\nlost race. What a work was this!

But the Lord is my\ndefence; and my God is the rock of my refuge. Psalm 94:21, 22.\nPlanted firmly upon the earth, and reaching heavenward to the\nthrone of God, is a ladder of shining brightness. God is above the\nladder, and His light is shining along its whole length. This ladder is\nChrist. Every round that you climb, you are coming step after step\ninto fellowship with the sufferings of Christ, and are becoming fash-\nioned after His divine similitude. The angels of God are constantly\nascending and descending this glorious ladder. They will not let you\nfall, if you keep your eye fixed upon the glory of God which is at\nthe top of the ladder....\nSatan is seeking to cast his hellish shadow across your pathway,\nthat he may hinder your journey heavenward. Act as though you\nhad within you a power from above, that in the name of Jesus Christ\nof Nazareth you may resist that power which is working intensely\nfrom beneath. To have in the heart the sweet, mellow Spirit of Jesus\nChrist is of more consequence than any amount of self-sufficiency\nand self-exaltation, which separate you from Christ.\nChrist teaches humanity never to be self-sufficient. He says,\n“Learn of me; ... I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest\nunto your souls” (Matthew 11:29). Learn of the One who was meek\nand lowly in heart—the One who has promised, “Ye shall find rest\nunto your souls.” This glorious experience will come, and you can\nsay, “I know Him! I know Him! I have tested Him; I have proved\nHim, and He has never failed me.” ...\nIf you send up your petition to God, He says He hears you. What\nis your evidence? Do you feel any better than before? Do you think\nof and examine your feelings to see if some great change has taken\nplace within? You should step out on the Word of God, and go\nstraight forward, knowing that He answers your prayers, because\nChristtheLadder,August30 525\nHe has promised to give, if you ask. Thus by exercising faith, [you]\nbring about the answer to your petitions. As you work to answer\nyour own prayers, you will find that God will reveal Himself unto\nyou.... Begin now to reach higher and still higher. Prize the things\nof heaven above earthly attractions and inducements.... Learn how\nto pray; learn how to bear a clear and intelligent testimony, and God\nwill be glorified in you. If you trust God, if you commit the keeping\nof your souls unto Him as unto a faithful Creator, you will have\n“Teachers to Have an Abiding Christ,” talk given at a church school\nteachers’ institute, Healdsburg, California."

But we\nare to go forward in the proclamation of the Word of the Lord. The\nend of all things is at hand. The coming of the Lord in the clouds of\nheaven, with power and great glory, is very near....\nIn the day of His coming, the last great trumpet is heard, and\nthere is a terrible shaking ofearthandheaven.

They can walk\nthrough the fire, as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego walked in\nthe midst of the furnace heated seven times hotter than it was wont\nto be heated. The Hebrew worthies could not be consumed, because\nScenesoftheSecondAdvent,September4 537\nthe form of the fourth, the Son of God, was with them. So in the\nday of the coming of the Lord, smoke and flame will be powerless\nto harm the righteous. Those who are united with the Lord will\nescape unscathed.

He imbues human agencies with\nhis own attributes. Evil angels united with evil men will put forth\nefforts to harass, persecute, and destroy. But the Lord God of Israel\nwill not forsake those who trust in Him. Amid the strengthening of\ninfidelity and apostasy, amid the pretended illumination which is\nthe blindest presumption and delusion, there will be a light from the\nsanctuary above shining upon God’s people. The truth of God will\ntriumph.\nThe commandments of God will be trampled underfoot, as they\nwere trampled upon by Satan in heaven. Unless God pours His\nconverting powerandgrace upon the soul, there willbe no attemptto\noppose Satan, but men will be under his control, his willing captives.\nThe enmity against Satan is put in man by God Himself. God calls\nuponHispeopletooccupyadistinct,decidedposition. Therighteous\nfervor with which Christ denounced every abomination in our world,\nthe unsullied purity, which made manifest the corruption of those\nthat deceived the people by an appearance of sanctity, excited bitter\nhostility against Him.\nToday the same attitude on the part of His people will call forth\nsimilar treatment. Every person will be arrayed under one of the two\nbanners. The chosen and loyal will stand under the bloodstained\nbanner of Prince Emmanuel, and all others under Satan’s standard.\nAll who are on Satan’s side will unite with him in honoring the\nspurious Sabbath, thus paying homage to the man of sin, who has\nexalted himself above all that is called God and [who] has thought\nto change times and laws. They trample upon the laws of Jehovah\nand frame laws to compel all to worship the false Sabbath, the idol\nBattleOverGod’sLaw,September5 539\nthey have exalted. But the day of deliverance to God’s people is not\nfar distant.\nI wish that all could appreciate the wonderful working of God\nin behalf of man. For fallen angels there has been no atonement;\nbut for fallen man a full and ample offering has been made to save\nto the uttermost all who shall come unto God by Him. He will\nnot turn away one repentant seeker. “For verily he took not on\nhim the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham\n[that humanity might reach humanity, and divinity lay hold upon\nHaskell."

It is the\ndepressing discouragements that are sapping your life forces. You\nmust be cheerful even though disappointed in men. Jesus under-\nstands; Jesus is true; Jesus is your Saviour.

I tell you, my brother, there is no\nmistake in this matter. I know what I am talking about. Be true\nto God, and you will do the work He has given you to do with\nfidelity. God lives and reigns. We have a living and a risen Saviour.\nHe has a care for you.... He has never proved false; He has never\ndeceived you. He will be your guide and deliverer in the most trying\ncircumstances. He will be at your right hand. We are every moment\ngirded with His power and surrounded by His presence as really as\nwere the Israelites in the midst of the divided sea.\nThe deepest and truest philosophy of life and faith is to bring\nourselves into the most intimate relation with God. God is giving\nyou an experience, and if you do not grieve too much and feel too\nkeenly, you will have physical strength. But sorrow and dissension\nand untruthfulness is to you a living death.

When within sight of\nthe hills of Canaan, the Israelites murmured because the stream\nthat had flowed wherever they encamped ceased. The cries of the\npeople were directed against Moses and Aaron, whom they accused\nof bringing them into the wilderness to perish. The leaders went\nto the door of the tabernacle and fell on their faces. Again “the\nglory of the Lord appeared,” and Moses was directed, “Take the rod,\nand gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother,\nand speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth\nhis water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock”\n(Numbers 20:8).\nThe two brothers went on before the multitude, Moses with the\nrod of God in his hand. They were now aged men. Long had they\nborne with the rebellion and obstinacy of Israel; but now, at last,\neven the patience of Moses gave way. “Hear now, ye rebels,” he\ncried; “must we fetch you water out of this rock?” (Verse 10). And\ninstead of speaking to the rock, as God had commanded him, he\nsmote it twice with the rod.\nThe water gushed forth in abundance to satisfy the host. But\na great wrong had been done. Moses had spoken from irritated\nfeeling.... “Shall we bring water?” he questioned, as if the Lord\nwould not do what He promised. “Ye believed me not,” the Lord\ndeclared to the two brothers, “to sanctify me in the eyes of the\nchildren of Israel” (Verse 12).\nMore than this, Moses and Aaron had assumed power that be-\nlongs only to God. The necessity for divine interposition made the\nHowGodLooksatSin,October12 615\noccasion one of great solemnity, and the leaders of Israel should\nhave improved it to impress the people with reverence for God and\nto strengthen their faith in His power and goodness. When they\nangrily cried, “Must we fetch you water out of this rock?” they put\nthemselves in God’s place, as if the power lay in themselves.

All that remains of\nour once large family is one of my sisters—and she is feeble. God\nhas given me strength. He is the health of my countenance. Every\nmorning I rejoice in Him. I know I have committed the keeping of\nmy soul to Him, as unto a faithful Creator; and I know He has never\nfailed me. If you place your trust in Him, the Lord will also give to\nevery one of you His strength, His grace, His salvation.\nWhen someone asks you how you are feeling, do not complain\nand murmur and try to think of something mournful to tell them to\ngain their sympathy; but grasp them by the hand, saying, “Praise\nGod! God is the Lord, and greatly to be praised! I love Him,\nbecause He first loved me.” Let your conversation be cheerful and\nhopeful. Do not talk discouragingly, telling your lack of faith and\nyoursorrowsandsufferings, forthedevildelightstohearsuchwords.\nWhen talking on gloomy subjects, you are glorifying the enemy.\nTalk faith and hope and courage, thus glorifying God.\nInstead of gossiping, thus creating mischief, let us tell of the\nmatchless power of Christ, and speak of His glory, thus magnifying\nand lifting up the Lord God of hosts and training ourselves to sing\nthe song of victory in the kingdom of glory. By beginning to sing\nsongs of triumph and thanksgiving now, we may prepare ourselves\nto sing the song of Moses and the Lamb when we meet on the sea of\nglass.\nCheerUp! SpeakWordsofCourage,October19 629\nThe Lord will be with us during this life, if we allow ourselves\nto be led by His Spirit and do not neglect to glorify His name.\nWe should bring as much of heaven as possible into this life. The\nlight of heaven shining into the heart will be imparted in words of\npleasantness, in deeds of kindness, to those who are near us. Having\nacquainted ourselves with God, when He comes we will be able to\nsay, “Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save\npreached in the St. Helena Sanitarium chapel."

We need to know what we\nshall do that we may work the works of God. “This is the work of\nGod, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent” (John 6:29). He\ncan be to us all that we desire.\nJesus proclaimed on the last great day of the feast, “If any man\nthirst, let him come unto me, and drink” (chap. 7:37); and again we\nhear Him saying, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy\nladen, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn\nof me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto\nyour souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light” (Matthew\n11:28-30).

There are many who have, and they\nknow that the words of Christ are verity and truth, and that when\ntrouble has come in like a flood, they have looked to Jesus and have\nbeen comforted and strengthened.\nChrist has promised that if we yoke up with Him we shall find\npeace and comfort and hope, and we [shall] know by experience\n[that] His words are true. He wants everyone to be saved. “For\nGod so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that\nwhosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting\nOvercomingPowerPromised,October20 631\nlife. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world;\nbut that the world through him might be saved” (John 3:16, 17)....\nJesus Christ knew that humanity had not power in itself to resist\nthe temptations of the enemy of souls, and therefore He clothed His\ndivinity with humanity, left His royal throne and high command,\nand came to this world all seared and marred with the curse, and\nhumiliated Himself, in order to set us an example.... He came to\nthis world, not to attend horse races, not to attend the theater, but\nHe came meek and lowly, and He invites us to learn of Him, the\nKing of glory.

He said, “I am the\nvoice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the\nLord, as said the prophet Esaias” (John 1:23)....\nNone who listened to the words of John and marked the earnest-\nness of his manner could doubt that he referred to the Christ who\nhad been so long promised to the world.... Multitudes accepted the\npreaching of John, and followed him from place to place. Many\ncherished in their hearts the hope that he was the Messiah. But as\nJohn saw the people turning to him, he sought to direct their minds\nto the coming One....\nIn this age, justpriorto the secondcoming ofChristin the clouds\nof heaven, such a work as that of John the Baptist is to be done. God\ncalls for men who will prepare a people to stand in the great day of\nthe Lord. The message preceding the public ministry of Christ was\n“Repent, publicans and sinners; repent, Pharisees and Sadducees;\nrepent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand” (see Matthew\n3:2). As a people who believe in Christ’s soon appearing, we have a\nmessage to bear, “Prepare to meet thy God.” Our message is to be\nas direct as was the message of John. He rebuked kings for their\niniquity. Notwithstanding that his life was imperiled, he did not\nhesitate to declare God’s Word; and our work in this age must be\ndone as faithfully. In order to give such a message as John gave, we\nmust have a spiritual experience like his.... We must behold God,\nand in beholding Him, lose sight of self.\nJohn had by nature the faults and weaknesses common to hu-\nmanity, but the touch of divine love had transformed him. When,\nafter Christ’s ministry began, the disciples of John came to him\nwith the complaint that all men were following the new teacher,\nJohn showed how clearly he understood his relation to the Messiah,\nHeMustIncrease,October21 633\nand how gladly he welcomed the One for whom he had prepared\nthe way.... “He must increase, but I must decrease” (John 3:30).\nLooking in faith to the Redeemer, John had risen to the height of\nself-abnegation. He sought not to attract men to himself, but to lift\ntheir thoughts higher and still higher, until they should rest upon the\nLamb of God....\nThose who are true to their calling as messengers for God will\nnot seek honor for themselves. Love for self will be swallowed up in\nlove for Christ. They will recognize that it is their work to proclaim,\nas did John the Baptist, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh\naway the sin of the world.” They will lift up Jesus, and with Him\n“Judge Not.”\nYe have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is\ngiven me to you-ward: how that by revelation he made known\nunto me the mystery. Ephesians 3:2, 3.\nThrough divine revelation, the plan of salvation, as wrought out\nby Christ, was laid open to Paul. Called of God, he was to teach\nmen that from a state of hopelessness, dead in trespasses and sins,\nthere was deliverance through the gospel of Jesus Christ. There\nwas life and power to reach forth unto holiness. Because of these\nrevelations, Paul was blessed with a marvelous insight. Though he\ncould not present to others all that he himself had seen, yet he was\nfirmly rooted and grounded in the truth. No suffering or reproach\ncould ever lead him to deny the great truths that had been revealed to\nhim. No presentation of false theories could lead him away from the\ninfluence of the grand views he had received of heavenly things....\nThe gospel as presented by Paul in his writings is just as powerful\ntoday as when it was written. To men in all ages is made known the\nrich treasures of the grace of Christ, the abundant love of God as\nrevealedthroughHisSon. Canwe, whileinacold, lifelesscondition,\nappreciate these truths?\nThegospelofChristwaspreachedtotheJewishnation. Hadthey\naccepted its truths, it would have proved their salvation.

But\nthey, as a nation, rejected Christ, refused His offers of mercy, and\nwere cut off from the parent vine, that the Gentiles might be grafted\nin. Still it is their privilege to become partakers with the Gentiles\nof the salvation of God. Belief in Christ will work in every man a\ntransformation of character.\nThrough the transforming grace of Christ, the fruits of the Spirit\nare made manifest in the life of those who were once dead in tres-\npasses and sins. In disposition, in words, and in actions, they are\nGospelIsPowerful,October22 635\nseen to be partakers of the divine nature. This wonderful grace was\nrevealed to Paul, and he worked constantly that others might be\nbrought to a knowledge of these saving truths.\nTo Jew and Gentile alike was the gospel preached under the\ndirection of the Holy Spirit. The middle wall of partition that had\nseparated the Jews was broken down in Christ Jesus. “For by one\nSpirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gen-\ntiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink\ninto one Spirit” (1 Corinthians 12:13).—Manuscript 111, October\n22, 1906, “A Warning Against Formation.”"

God wants us to take the words home to every\nheart.\n“For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every trans-\ngression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;\nhow shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the\nfirst began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by\nthem that heard him?” (Hebrews 2:2, 3).

We have\nnothing to fear from them while they spend more strength fighting\none another than in warfare with my forces.”\nAfter the descent of the Holy Spirit, the disciples went forth\nto proclaim a risen Saviour, their one desire the salvation of souls.\nThey rejoiced in the sweetness of communion with saints. They\nwere tender, thoughtful, self-denying, willing to make any sacrifice\nfor the truth’s sake. In their daily association with one another they\nrevealed the love that Christ had commanded them to reveal. By\nunselfish words and deeds they strove to kindle this love in other\nhearts....\nBut the early Christians began to look for defects in one another.\nDwelling upon mistakes, encouraging suspicion and doubt, giving\nwaytounkindcriticism, theylostsightoftheSaviourandofthegreat\nlove He had revealed for sinners. They became more strict in regard\nto outward ceremonies, more particular about the theory of the faith,\nmore severe in their criticisms. In their zeal to condemn others,\nthey themselves erred. They forgot the lesson of brotherly love that\nChrist had taught. And, saddest of all, they were unconscious of\ntheir loss. They did not realize that happiness and joy were going\nout of their lives, and that soon they would walk in darkness, having\nshut the love of God out of their hearts.\nThe apostle John realized that brotherly love was waning in the\nchurch, and he dwelt particularly upon this point. Up to the day of\nBlendinUnity,December10 737\nhis death, he urged upon believers the constant exercise of love for\none another....\nIn the church of God today brotherly love is greatly lacking.\nMany of those who profess to love the Saviour neglect to love those\nwho are united with them in Christian fellowship....\nHarmony and unity existing among men of varied dispositions\nis the strongest witness that can be borne that God has sent His Son\ninto the world to save sinners. It is our privilege to bear this witness.\nBut in order to do this, we must place ourselves under Christ’s\ncommand. Our characters must be molded in harmony with Christ’s\ncharacter; our wills must be surrendered to His will.—Manuscript"

        "content": "Those who walk in the narrow way must follow the directions\nof the Guidebook. Thus only can they reach the gates of the City of\nGod....\nGod has put men and women in possession of precious gifts. To\ndifferent ones He has given different gifts. Not all have the same\nstrength of character or the same depth of knowledge. But each one\nis to use his gifts in the Master’s service, however small this gift\nmay seem to be. The faithful steward trades wisely on the goods\nentrusted to him.\nThe endowments of mind and body are to be carefully guarded.\nOur gifts are not to be weakened by self-indulgence. Every power\nis to be carefully preserved, that it may always be ready for instant\nuse. No part of the physical organism is to be weakened by misuse.\nEach part, however small, has an influence on the whole. The abuse\nof one nerve or muscle lessens the usefulness of the whole body.\nThose for whom Christ has given His life should bring their habits\nand practices into conformity to His will.\nGod’sWorddeclares,“Thesoulthatsinneth,itshalldie”(Ezekiel\n18:20). But God does not desire the death of anyone. At infinite cost\nHe provided for man a second probation. He “so loved the world\nthat he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him\nshould not perish, but have everlasting life” (John 3:16).\nShould not those to whom the light of truth for this time has\ncome place themselves in close connection with God, using their\ncapabilities to advance the work of soul saving? Should not the\none who possesses an understanding of the Scriptures impart the\nknowledge given him to those who know not the truth?\nUpon every believer in present truth rests the responsibility of\nworking for sinners. God points them to their special work—the\nStewardsofGod’sGrace,December31 779\nproclamation of the third angel’s message. They are to show their\nappreciation of God’s great gift by consecrating themselves to the\nwork for which Christ gave His life. They are to be stewards of the\ngrace of God, dispensing to others the blessings bestowed on them.\nHe who has found comfort in the Word of God is to share this\ncomfortwithothers.
