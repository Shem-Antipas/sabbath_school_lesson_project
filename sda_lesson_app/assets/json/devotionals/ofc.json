How much greater privilege it is to be\nsons and daughters of the Most High. What greater privilege could\nbe conferred on us than to be given entrance into the royal family?\nIn order to become the sons and daughters of God, we must\nseparate from the world. “Come out from among them, and be ye\nseparate,” the Lord says, “and I will be a Father unto you, and ye\nshall be my sons and daughters.” ...\nThere is a heaven before us, a crown of life to win. But to the\novercomer only is the reward given. He who gains heaven must be\nclothed with the robe of righteousness. “Every man that hath this\nhope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.” In the character\nof Christ there was no discord of any kind. And this must be our\nexperience. Our lives must be controlled by the principles that\ncontrolled His life.\nThrough the perfection of the sacrifice given for the guilty race,\nthose who believe in Christ, coming unto Him, may be saved from\neternal ruin....\nLet no one be so deluded by the enemy as to think that it is a\ncondescension for any man, however talented or learned or honored,\nto accept Christ. Every human being should look to heaven with\nreverence and gratitude, and exclaim with amazement, “Behold,\nwhat manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we\nshould be called the sons of God.”"

It is a supernatural work, bringing a\nsupernatural element into human nature. The soul that is yielded\nto Christ becomes His own fortress, which He holds in a revolted\nworld, and He intends that no authority shall be known in it but His\nown. A soul thus kept in possession by the heavenly agencies is\nimpregnable to the assaults of Satan.\nChrist is ready to impart all heavenly influences. He knows every\ntemptation that comes to man, and the capabilities of every human\nagent. He weighs his strength. He sees the present and the future,\nand presents before the mind the obligations that should be met, and\nurges that common, earthly things shall not be permitted to be so\nabsorbing that eternal things shall be lost out of reckoning.\nThe gifts of His grace through Christ are free to all. There is no\nelection but one’s own by which any may perish. God has set forth\nin His Word the conditions upon which every soul will be elected\nto eternal life—obedience to His commandments, through faith in\nChrist. God has elected a character in harmony with His law, and\nany one who shall reach the standard of His requirement, will have\nan entrance into the kingdom of glory. Christ Himself said, “He that\nbelieveth on the Son hath everlasting life.”\nWhat an exalted position to be identified with one in whom is\nall perfection centered, who is indeed the Majesty of heaven, but\nwho loved us, although fallen, so much that language cannot express\nit! He for our sakes laid aside His royal robe, stepped down from\nthe throne of heaven, and condescended to clothe His divinity with [19]\nhumility, and became like one of us except in sin, that His life and\ncharacter should be a pattern for all to copy, that they might have the\nprecious gift of eternal life.\nThe Spirit Brings Wisdom And Understanding,"

Every revelation of God to\nthe soul increases the capacity to know and to love. The continual\ncry of the heart is, “More of Thee,” and ever the Spirit’s answer is,\n“Much more.” For our God delights to do “exceeding abundantly\nabove all that we ask or think.” To Jesus, who emptied Himself for\nthe salvation of lost humanity, the Holy Spirit was given without\nmeasure.

The\nangels, who do always behold the face of the Father in heaven,\nwould prefer to remain close by the side of God, in the pure and\nholy atmosphere of heaven; but a work must be done in bringing\nthis heavenly atmosphere to the souls who are tempted and tried,\nthat Satan may not disqualify them for the place the Lord would\nhave them fill in the heavenly courts.

Our affection for one another springs from our common\nrelation to God. We are one family, we love one another as He loved\nus. When compared with this true, sanctified, disciplined affection,\nthe shallow courtesy of the world, the meaningless expression of\neffusive friendship, are as chaff to the wheat.\nTo love as Christ loved means to manifest unselfishness at all\ntimes and in all places, by kind words and pleasant looks.... Genuine\nlove is a precious attribute of heavenly origin, which increases its\nfragrance in proportion as it is dispensed to others...\nChrist’s love is deep and earnest, flowing like an irrepressible\nstream to all who will accept it.

The Lord Jesus is very near to those who thus\nappreciate His gracious gifts, tracing all their good things back to\nthe benevolent, loving, care-taking God, and recognizing Him as\nthe great Fountain of all comfort and consolation, the inexhaustible\nSource of grace.\nIf we would give more expression to our faith, rejoice more in\nthe blessings that we know we have,—the great mercy and love of\nGod,—we should have more faith and greater joy. No tongue can\nexpress, no finite mind can conceive, the blessing that results from\nappreciating the goodness and love of God. Even on earth we may\n46 OurFatherCares\nhave joy as a wellspring, never failing, because fed by the streams\nthat flow from the throne of God."

Love\nwas the element in which Christ moved and walked and worked. He\ncame to embrace the world in the arms of His love...\nWe are to follow the example set by Christ, and make Him\nour pattern, until we shall have the same love for others as He has\nmanifested for us. He seeks to impress us with this profound lesson\nof love.... If your hearts have been given to selfishness, let Christ\nimbue you with His love. He desires that we shall love Him fully,\nand encourages, yes, even commands, that we shall love others\nas He has given us an example. He has made love the badge of\nour discipleship.... This is the measurement to which you are to\nreach,—“Love one another; as I have loved you.” What height, what\ndepth and breadth of love! This love is not simply to embrace a\nfew favorites, it is to reach to the lowliest and humblest of God’s\ncreatures. Jesus says, “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the\nleast of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” ...\nThe love and sympathy which Jesus would have us give to others\ndoes not savor of sentimentalism, which is a snare to the soul; it\nis a love that is of heavenly extraction, which Jesus exemplifies by\nboth precept and example. But instead of manifesting this love, how\noften we are alienated and estranged one from another.... The result\nis estrangement from God, a dwarfed experience, a blighting of\nChristian growth....\nThe love of Jesus is an active principle, uniting heart with heart\nin bonds of Christian fellowship. Every one who enters heaven will\n50 OurFatherCares\non earth have been perfected in love; for in heaven the Redeemer\nand the redeemed will be objects of our interest.\nWe Are To Overcome As Christ Overcame, January [28]\nThese things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have\npeace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good\ncheer; I have overcome the world. John 16:33.\nSatan made stronger attacks upon Christ than he will ever make\nupon us. There was much at stake with him, whether Christ or\nhimself should be conqueror. If Christ resisted his most powerful\ntemptations, and Satan did not succeed in leading Him to sin, he\nknew that he must lose his power, and finally be punished with\neverlasting destruction. Therefore Satan worked with mighty power\nto lead Christ to do a wrong action, forthen he would gain advantage\nover Him.... You can never be tempted in so determined and cruel\nmanner as was our Saviour. Satan was upon His path every moment.\nWill man take hold of divine power, and with determination and\nperseverance resist Satan, as Christ has given him example in His\nconflict with the foe in the wilderness of temptation? God cannot\nsave man against his will from the power of Satan’s artifices. Man\nmust work with his human power, aided by the divine power of\nChrist, to resist and to conquer at any cost to himself. In short, man\nmust overcome as Christ overcame. And then, through the victory\nthat it is his privilege to gain by the all-powerful name of Jesus, he\nmay become an heir of God and joint-heir with Jesus Christ. This\ncould not be the case if Christ alone did all the overcoming. Man\nmust do his part; he must be victor on his own account, through the\nstrength and grace that Christ gives him. Man must be a co-worker\nwith Christ in the labor of overcoming, and then he will be partaker\nwith Christ in His glory.\nThe Saviour overcame to show man how he may overcome.\nAll the temptations of Satan, Christ met with the Word of God.\nBy trusting in God’s promises, He received power to obey God’s\ncommandments, and the tempter could gain no advantage.\nJesus Is A Friend That Is Closer Than A Brother,"

        "content": "Rest yourself wholly in the hands of Jesus. Contemplate His\ngreat love, and while you meditate upon His self-denial, His infinite\nsacrifice made in our behalf in order that we should believe in Him,\nyour heart will be filled with holy joy, calm peace, and indescribable\nlove. As we talk of Jesus, as we call upon Him in prayer, our\n[37] confidence that He is our personal, loving Saviour will strengthen,\nand His character will appear more and more lovely.... We may\nenjoy rich feasts of love, and as we fully believe that we are His\nby adoption, we may have a foretaste of heaven. Wait upon the\nLord in faith. The Lord draws out the soul in prayer, and gives\nus to feel His precious love. We have a nearness to Him, and can\nhold sweet communion with Him. We obtain distinct views of His\ntenderness and compassion, and our hearts are broken and melted\nwith contemplation of the love that is given to us. We feel indeed\nan abiding Christ in the soul.... Our peace is like a river, wave after\nwave of glory rolls into the heart, and indeed we sup with Jesus and\nHe with us. We have a realizing sense of the love of God, and we\nrestin His love. No language can describe it, itis beyondknowledge.\nWe are one with Christ, our life is hid with Christ in God. We have\nthe assurance that when He who is our life shall appear, then shall\nwe also appear with Him in glory. With strong confidence, we can\ncall God our Father. Whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s. His\nSpirit makes us like Jesus Christ in temper, and disposition, and we\nrepresent Christ to others. When Christ is abiding in the soul the\nfact cannot be hid; for He is like a well of water springing up into\neverlasting life. We can but represent the likeness of Christ in our\ncharacter, and our words, our deportment, produces in others a deep,\nabiding, increasing love for Jesus, and we make manifest ... that we\nare conformed to the image of Jesus Christ."

God is moving upon every\nmind that is open to receive the impressions of His Holy Spirit.\nHe is sending our messengers that they may give the warning in\nevery locality. God is testing the devotion of His churches and their\nwillingness to render obedience to the Spirit’s guidance. Knowledge\nis to be increased. The messengers of Heaven are to be seen running\nto and fro, seeking in every possible way to warn the people of\nthe coming judgments and presenting the glad tidings of salvation\nthrough our Lord Jesus Christ.

The Spirit of God is moving upon men’s hearts, and\nthose who respond to its influence will become lights in the world.\nEverywhere they are seen going forth to communicate to others the\nlight they have received as they did after the descent of the Holy\nSpirit on the day of Pentecost. And as they let their light shine, they\nreceive more and more of the Spirit’s power.

Servants of God, endowed with power from on\nhigh, with their faces lighted up, and shining with holy consecration,\nwent forth to proclaim the message from heaven.\nMany were praising God. The sick were healed, and other mira-\ncles were wrought. A spirit of intercession was seen, even as was\nmanifested before the great Day of Pentecost.

Hearts were convicted by the power of the Holy Spirit, and a\nspirit of genuine conversion was manifest. On every side doors were\nthrown open to the proclamation of the truth.

Let not your heart be troubled,\nneither let it be afraid. John 14:27.\nThere always have been and always will be two classes on the\nearth to the end of time—the believers in Jesus, and those who\nreject Him. Sinners, however wicked, abominable, and corrupt, by\nfaith in Him will be purified, made clean, through the doing of His\nword.... Those who reject Christ and refuse to believe the truth will\nbe filled with bitterness against those who accept Jesus as a personal\nSaviour. But those who receive Christ are melted and subdued by\nthe manifestation of His love and His humiliation, suffering, and\ndeath in their behalf....\nThe peace that Christ gave to His disciples, and for which we\npray, is the peace that is born of truth, a peace that is not to be\nquenched because of division. Without may be wars and fightings,\njealousies, envies, hatred, strife; but the peace of Christ is not that\nwhich the world giveth or taketh away. It could endure amid the\nhunting of spies and the fiercest opposition of His enemies.... Christ\ndid not for an instant seek to purchase peace by a betrayal of sacred\ntrusts. Peace could not be made by a compromise of principles....\nIt is a grave mistake on the part of those who are children of God\nto seek to bridge the gulf that separates the children of light from\nthe children of darkness by yielding principle, by compromising the\ntruth. It would be surrendering the peace of Christ in order to make\npeace or fraternize with the world. The sacrifice is too costly to be\nmade by the children of God to make peace with the world by giving\nup the principles of truth.... Then let the followers of Christ settle\nit in their minds that they will never compromise truth, never yield\none iota of principle for the favor of the world. Let them hold to the\npeace of Christ."

Then you\ncan cast your glittering crowns at the feet of Jesus, take your golden\nharps, and fill all heaven with melody. We shall praise Him with an [46]\nimmortal tongue.\nAs our Redeemer leads us to the threshold of the Infinite, flushed\nwith the glory of God, we may catch the themes of praise and\nthanksgiving from the heavenly choir round about the throne; and as\nthe echo ofthe angels’ song is awakenedin ourearthlyhomes, hearts\nwill be drawn closer to the heavenly singers. Heaven’s communion\nbegins on earth. We learn here the keynote of its praise.\nPraise the Lord; talk of His goodness; tell of His power. Sweeten\nthe atmosphere that surrounds your soul....

        "content": "Faith is not an opiate, but a stimulant. Looking to Calvary will\nnot quiet your soul into nonperformance of duty, but will create faith\nthat will work, purifying the soul from all selfishness.\nThe faith in Christ which saves the soul is not what it is repre-\nsented to be by many. “Believe, believe,” is their cry; “only believe\nin Christ, and you will be saved. It is all you have to do.” While\ntrue faith trusts wholly in Christ for salvation, it will lead to perfect\nconformity to the law of God.\nThere are two errors against which the children of God—partic-\nularly those who have just come to trust in His grace—especially\nneed to guard. The first ... is that of looking to their own works,\ntrusting to anything they can do, to bring themselves into harmony\nwith God. He who is trying to become holy by his own works in\nkeeping the law, is attempting an impossibility.... It is the grace of\nChrist alone, through faith, that can make us holy.\nThe opposite and no less dangerous error is that belief in Christ\nreleases men from keeping the law of God; that since by faith alone\n[69] we become partakers of the grace of Christ, our works have nothing\nto do with our redemption.\nButnotice here thatobedience is nota mere outwardcompliance,\nbut the service of love. The law of God is an expression of His very\nnature; it is an embodiment of the great principle of love, and hence\nis the foundation of His government in heaven and earth.... Instead\nof releasing man from obedience, it is faith, and faith only, that\nmakes us partakers of the grace of Christ, which enables us to render\nobedience.\nAs Jesus was in human nature, so God means His followers to\nbe. In His strength we are to live the life of purity and nobility which\nthe Saviour lived."

That power\nis Christ. His grace alone can quicken the lifeless faculties of the\nsoul, and attract it to God, to holiness.... The idea that it is necessary\nonly to develop the good that exists in man by nature, is a fatal\ndeception. “The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of\nGod: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them,\nbecause they are spiritually discerned.” 1 Corinthians 2:14....

Yet amid all this he loves God, he chooses\nto do His will, and prizes nothing so highly as His approbation. In\nthe conflicting trials and changing scenes of this life, he knows that\nthere is One who knows it all, One who will bend His ear low to the\ncry of the sorrowful and distressed, One who can sympathize with\nevery sorrow and soothe the keen anguish of every heart....\nAmid all his affliction, the Christian has strong consolation. And\nif God permits him to suffer a lingering, distressing sickness before\nhe closes his eyes in death, he can with cheerfulness bear it all.... He\ncontemplates the future with heavenly satisfaction. A short rest in\nthe grave, and then the Life-giver will break the fetters of the tomb,\nrelease the captive, and bring him from his dusty bed immortal,\nnever more to know pain, sorrow, or death. Oh, what a hope is the\nChristian’s! Let this hope of the Christian be mine. Let it be yours"

        "content": "Diligent heart-keeping is essential to a healthy growth in grace.\nThe heart in its natural state is a habitation for unholy thoughts and\nsinful passions. When brought into subjection to Christ, it must be\ncleansed by the Spirit from all defilement. This can not be done\nwithout the consent of the individual.\nWhen the soul has been cleansed, it is the duty of the Christian [101]\nto keep it undefiled. Many seem to think that the religion of Christ\ndoes not call for the abandonment of daily sins, the breaking loose\nfrom habits which have held the soul in bondage. They renounce\nsome things condemned by the conscience, but they fail to represent\nChrist in the daily life. They do not bring Christlikeness into the\nhome. They do not show a thoughtful care in their choice of words.\nToo often, fretful, impatient words are spoken, words which stir\nthe worst passions of the human heart. Such ones need the abiding\npresence of Christ in the soul. Only in His strength can they keep\nguard over the words and actions.\nIn the work of heart-keeping we must be instant in prayer, un-\nwearied in petitioning the throne of grace for assistance. Those who\ntake the name of Christian should come to God in earnestness and\nhumility, pleading for help.... The Christian cannot always be in\nthe position of prayer, but his thoughts and desires can always be\nupward.\nTo keep your heart in heaven will give vigor to all your graces\nand put life into all your duties. To discipline the mind to dwell upon\nheavenly things will put life and earnestness into all our endeavors.\nOur efforts are languid, and we run the Christian race slowly, and\nmanifest indolence and sloth, because we so little value the heavenly\nprize. We are dwarfs in spiritual attainments. It is the privilege and\n188 OurFatherCares\nduty of the Christian to be increasing in the knowledge of the Son\nof God, “unto a perfect man.”"

If the practice of the Word is not brought into\nthe life, then the sword of the Spirit has not wounded the natural\nheart. It has been shielded in poetic fancy.

They may choose to be polished or\nto remain unpolished. But everyone who is pronounced worthy of\na place in the Lord’s temple must submit to the polishing process.\nWithout the polishing that the Lord gives they can reflect no more\nlight than a common pebble.\nChrist says to man, “You are mine.

        "content": "The Christian is likened to the cedar of Lebanon. I have read\nthat this tree does more than send down a few short roots into the\nyielding loam. It sends strong roots deep down into the earth, and\nstrikes down farther and still farther in search of a still stronger hold.\nAnd in the fierce blast of the tempest, it stands firm, held by its\nnetwork of cables beneath.\nSo the Christian strikes root deep into Christ. He has faith in his\nRedeemer. He knows in whom he believes. He is fully persuaded\nthat Jesus is the Son of God and the Saviour of sinners.... The roots\nof faith strike deep down. Genuine Christians, like the cedar of\nLebanon, do not grow in the soft surface soil, but are rooted in God,\nriveted in the clefts of the mountain rocks.\nIf the Christian thrives and progresses at all, he must do so amid\nstrangers to God, amid scoffing, subject to ridicule. He must stand\nupright like the palm tree in the desert. The sky may be as brass, the\ndesert sand may beat about the palm tree’s roots, and pile itself in\nheaps about its trunk. Yet the tree lives as an evergreen, fresh and\nvigorous amid the burning desert sands. Remove the sand till you\nreach the rootlets of the palm tree, and you discover the secret of its\nlife; it strikes down deep beneath the surface, to the secret waters\nhidden in the earth.\nAs the palm tree, drawing nourishment from fountains of living\nwater, is green and flourishing in the midst of the desert, so the\nChristian may draw rich supplies of grace from the fountain of\nGod’s love, and may guide weary souls, that are full of unrest and\nready to perish in the desert of sin, to those waters of which they\nmay drink, and live. The Christian is ever pointing his fellow men\nto Jesus, who invites, “If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and\nRootedInChrist,April27 213\ndrink.” John 7:37.

The sin of the whole world was\nlaid upon Jesus, and divinity gave its highest value to the suffering of\nhumanity in Jesus that the whole world might be pardoned through\nfaith in the Substitute. The most guilty need have no fear but that\nGod will pardon, for because of the efficacy of the divine sacrifice\nthe penalty of the law will be remitted. Through Christ the sinner\nmay return to allegiance to God.\nHow wonderful is the plan of redemption in its simplicity and\nfullness. It not only provides for the full pardon of the sinner but\nalso forthe restoration of the transgressor, making a way whereby he\nmay be accepted as a son of God. Through obedience he may be the\npossessor of love and peace and joy. His faith may unite him in his\nweakness to Christ, the source of divine strength, and through the\nmerits of Christ he may find the approval of God, because Christ has\nsatisfied the demands of the law, and He imputes His righteousness\nto the penitent, believing soul....\nWhat love, what wonderful love, was displayed by the Son of\nGod....Christ takes the sinner from the lowest degradation, and pu-\nrifies, refines, and ennobles him. By beholding Jesus as He is, the\nsinner is transformed and elevated to the very summit of dignity,\neven to a seat with Christ upon his throne....\nThe plan of redemption provides for every emergency and for\nevery want of the soul. If it were deficient in any way, the sinner\nmight find some excuse to plead for neglect of its terms, but the\ninfinite God had a knowledge of every human necessity, and ample\nprovision has been made to supply every need.... What, then, can\nthe sinner say in the great day of final judgment as to why he refused\nProvisionForEveryEmergency,May8 237\nto give attention, the most thorough and earnest, to the salvation\nproffered him?"

We should study\nthe Pattern, that the spirit which dwelt in Christ may dwell in us.\nThe Saviour was not found among the exalted and honorable of the\nworld. He did not spend His time among those who were seeking\ntheir ease and pleasure. He worked to help those who needed help,\nto save the lost and perishing, to lift up the bowed down, to break the\nyoke of oppression from those in bondage, to heal the afflicted, and\nto speak words of sympathy and consolation to the distressed and\nsorrowing. We are required to follow this example. The more we\npartake of the spirit of Christ, the more we shall seek to do for our\nfellow men. We shall bless the needy and comfort the distressed....\nProbation is about to close....

He is working to remove from us everything of a\nspiritual nature, and in the place of the precious graces of Christ to\ncrowd ourhearts with the evil traits of the carnal nature—hatred, evil\nsurmising, jealousy, love of the world, love of self, love of pleasure,\nand the pride of life. We need to be fortified against the incoming\nfoe, ... for unless we are watchful and prayerful these evils will enter\nthe heart and crowd out all that is good.\nHow greatis the responsibility placedupon the disciple ofChrist.\nHow imperative the duty to reflect the light of heaven upon a world\n[165] enshrouded in darkness.

When we take the name of Christ we pledge ourselves\nto representHim. In orderforus to be true to ourpledge, Christmust\nbe formed within, the hope of glory. The daily life must become\nmore and more like the Christ life. We must be Christians in deed\nand in truth. Christ will have nothing to do with pretense. He will\nwelcome to the heavenly courts those only whose Christianity is\ngenuine. The lives of professed Christians who do not live the life\nof Christ are a mockery to religion.\nGod does not ask us to purchase His favor by any costly sacrifice.\nHe asks only for the service of a humble, contrite heart, which has\ngladly and thankfully accepted His free gift. The one who receives\nChrist as his personal Saviour has in his possession the salvation\nprovided by Christ. And he is never to forget that as he has freely\nreceived, so he is freely to impart.\nDo you realize your value in the sight of God? He says, Ye are\nlaborers together with Me. Are you letting your light shine in clear\nrays to a fallen world? Are you seeking to exercise every faculty and\nevery power which God has given you? You may not be a minister,\nbut you can be a witness. You may not be an eloquent speaker, but\nyou can be eloquent in living Christ, you can be eloquent in letting\nyour light shine before men.\nA true, lovable Christian is the most powerful argument that\ncan be advanced in favor of Bible truth.

So in the time of trouble, if the people of\nGod had unconfessed sins to appear before them while tortured with\nfear and anguish, they would be overwhelmed; despair would cut off\ntheir faith, and they could not have confidence to plead with God for\ndeliverance.

The more exalted their profession, and\nthe more honorable the position which they hold, the more grievous\nis their course in the sight of God, and the more certain the triumph\nof the great adversary.\nYet Jacob’s history is an assurance that God will not cast off\nthose who have been betrayed into sin, but who have returned unto\nHim with true repentance. It was by self-surrender and confiding\nfaith that Jacob gained what he had failed to gain by conflict in his\nown strength. God thus taught His servant that divine power and\ngrace alone could give him the blessing he craved. Thus it will be\nwith those who live in the last days. As dangers surround them,\nand despair seizes upon the soul, they must depend solely upon\nthe merits of the atonement.... None will ever perish while they do\nthis....\nJacob prevailed because he was persevering and determined....\nIt is now that we are to learn this lesson of prevailing prayer, of\nunyielding faith. The greatest victories to the church of Christ or\n360 OurFatherCares\nto the individual Christian are not those that are gained by talent or\neducation, by wealth or the favor of men. They are those victories\nthat are gained in the audience chamber with God, when earnest,\nagonizing faith lays hold upon the mighty arm of power."

        "verse_ref": " Hebrews 11:27",
        "content": "Moses had a deep sense of the personal presence of God. He\nwas not only looking down through the ages for Christ to be made\nmanifest in the flesh, but he saw Christ in a special manner accom-\npanying the children of Israel in all their travels. God was real to\nhim, ever present in his thoughts. When misunderstood, when called\nupon to face danger and to bear insult for Christ’s sake, he endured\nwithout retaliation. Moses believed in God as one whom he needed\nand who would help him because of his need. God was to him a\npresent help.\nMuch of the faith which we see is merely nominal; the real, trust-\ning, persevering faith is rare. Moses realized in his own experience\nthe promise that God will be a rewarder to those who diligently seek\nHim. He had respect unto the recompense of the reward. Here is\nanother point in regard to faith which we wish to study; God will\nreward the man of faith and obedience. If this faith is brought into\nthe life experience, it will enable everyone who fears and loves God\nto endure trials. Moses was full of confidence in God because he had\nappropriating faith. He needed help, and he prayed for it, grasped\nit by faith, and wove into his experience the belief that God cared\nfor him. He believed that God ruled his life in particular. He saw\nand acknowledged God in every detail of his life and felt that he was\nunder the eye of the All-seeing One, who weighs motives, who tries\nthe heart. He looked to God and trusted in Him for strength to carry\nhim uncorrupted through every form of temptation.... The presence\nof God was sufficient to carry him through the most trying situations\nin which a man could be placed.\nMoses did not merely think of God; he saw Him. God was the\nconstant vision before him; he never lost sight of His face. He saw\nJesus as his Saviour, and he believed that the Saviour’s merits would\n362 OurFatherCares\nbe imputed to him. This faith was to Moses no guesswork; it was a\nreality. This is the kind of faith we need, faith that will endure the\ntest. Oh, how often we yield to temptation because we do not keep\nour eye upon Jesus!"

        "content": "“And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to [177]\nlead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light.”\n... The standard of their invisible Leader was ever with them. By\nday the cloud directed their journeyings or spread as a canopy above\nthe host. It served as a protection from the burning heat, and by its\ncoolness and moisture afforded grateful refreshment in the parched,\nthirsty desert. By night it became a pillar of fire, illuminating their\nencampment and constantly assuring them of the divine presence.\nIn one of the most beautiful and comforting passages of Isaiah’s\nprophecy, reference is made to the pillar of cloud and of fire to\nrepresent God’s care for His people in the great final struggle with\nthe powers of evil: “The Lord will create upon every dwelling place\nof Mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day,\nand the shining of a flaming fire by night: for above all the glory\nshall be a covering. And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in\nthe daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert\nfrom storm and from rain” (Isaiah 4:5, 6, margin).\nIn the time of trial before us God’s pledge of security will be\nplaced upon those who have kept the word of His patience. Christ\nwill say to His faithful ones: “Come, my people, enter thou into thy\nchambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a\nlittle moment until the indignation be overpast” (Isaiah 26:20). The\nLion of Judah, so terrible to the rejectors of His grace, will be the\nLamb of God to the obedient and faithful. The pillar of cloud which\nspeaks wrath and terror to the transgressor of God’s law is light and\nmercy and deliverance to those who have kept His commandments.\nThe arm strong to smite the rebellious will be strong to deliver the\nloyal. Every faithful one will surely be gathered. “He shall send his\nangels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together\n364 OurFatherCares\nhis elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other”\n(Matthew 24:31)."

These were at first very humble, and not\nalways pleasant; but they were performed to the best of his ability,\nand with a willing heart....\nIf children were taught to regard the humble round of everyday\nduties as the course marked out for them by the Lord, as a school in\nwhich they were to be trained to render faithful and efficient service,\nhow much more pleasant and honorable would their work appear.\nTo perform every duty as unto the Lord, throws a charm around the\nhumblest employment and links the workers on earth with the holy\nbeings who do God’s will in heaven.\nThe life of Samuel from early childhood had been a life of piety\nand devotion. He had been placed under the care of Eli in his youth,\nand the loveliness of his character drew forth the warm affection\nof the aged priest. He was kind, generous, diligent, obedient, and\nrespectful. The contrast between the course of the youth Samuel and\nthat of the priest’s own sons was very marked, and Eli found rest and\ncomfort and blessing in the presence of his charge. It was a singular\nthing that between Eli, the chief magistrate of the nation, and the\nsimple child so warm a friendship should exist.

As the infirmities of age came upon Eli, he\nfelt more keenly the disheartening, reckless, profligate course of his\nown sons, and he turned to Samuel for comfort and support.\nHow touching to see youth and old age relying one upon the\nother, the youth looking up to the aged for counsel and wisdom,\nthe aged looking to the youth for help and sympathy. This is as it [181]\nshould be. God would have the young possess such qualifications of\n372 OurFatherCares\ncharacter that they shall find delight in the friendship of the old, that\nthey may be united in the endearing bonds of affection to those who\nare approaching the borders of the grave."

Yet the Saviour attempted no civil reforms.\nHe attacked no national abuses, nor condemned the national ene-\nmies. He did not interfere with the authority or administration of\nthose in power. He who was our example kept aloof from earthly\ngovernments. Not because He was indifferent to the woes of men,\nbut because the remedy did not lie in merely human and external\nmeasures. To be efficient, the cure must reach men individually, and\nmust regenerate the heart.\nSome of the Pharisees had come to Jesus demanding “when\nthe kingdom of God should come” (Luke 17:20). More than three\nyears had passed since John the Baptist gave the message that like\na trumpet call had sounded through the land, “The kingdom of\nheaven is at hand” (Matthew 3:2). And as yet these Pharisees saw\nno indication of the establishment of the kingdom....\nJesus answered, “The kingdom of God cometh not with outward\nshow [margin]: neither shall they say, Lo here! or lo there! for,\nbehold, the kingdom of God is within you.” The kingdom of God\nbegins at the heart.

As one with us, He must bear the burden\nof our guilt and woe. The Sinless One must feel the shame of sin.\nThe peace lover must dwell with strife, the truth must abide with\nfalsehood, purity with vileness. Every sin, every discord, every\ndefiling lust that transgression had brought, was torture to His spirit.\nAlone He must tread the path; alone He must bear the burden.\nUpon Him who had laid off His glory and accepted the weakness of\nhumanity the redemption of the world must rest. He saw and felt it\nall, but His purpose remained steadfast. Upon His arm depended the\nsalvation of the fallen race, and He reached out His hand to grasp\nthe hand of Omnipotent love.\nThe loneliness of Christ, separated from the heavenly courts,\nliving the life of humanity, was never understood or appreciated by\nthe disciples as it should have been... When Jesus was no longer\nwith them, ... they began to see how they might have shown Him\nattentions that would have brought gladness to His heart....\nThe same want is evident in our world today.

In the prayer of the\nDivineSubstitute,September18 509\npoor thief, there was a note different from that which was sounding\non every side; it was a note of faith, and it reached to Christ.

If\nHe had not been without spot or stain of sin, He could not have been\nthe Saviour of mankind. He was a Sinbearer, needing no atonement.\nOne with God in purity and holiness of character, He could make a\npropitiation for the sins of the whole world.\nChrist is the light of the world. Through Him light is shining\namid the moral darkness. If He were not light, the darkness would\nnot be apparent, because light reveals darkness. The clearer the light,\nthe more manifest the contrast between light and darkness.

A\nPhysician, a Healer, He came to restore the moral image of God that\nwas lost by transgression.\nWhen Christ abides in the soul by faith, He makes the one who\nloves Him all light in the Lord. It is true that many who say they\nbelieve the truth have only a nominal faith. They are not doers of the\nWord. They profess to believe, but their profession will not convert\nthem....\nWhen Christ dwells in the heart, His presence is apparent. Good\nand pleasant words and actions reveal the Spirit of Christ.

Though John in\nhis Epistles dwells so fully upon love, yet he does not hesitate to\nreveal the true character of that class who claim to be sanctified\nwhile living in transgression of the law of God. “He that saith, I\nknow him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the\ntruth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the\nlove of God perfected” (chap. 2:4, 5).\nHere is the test of every man’s profession. We cannot accord\nholiness to any man without bringing him to the measurement of\nGod’s only standard of holiness in heaven and in earth. If men feel\nno weight of the moral law, if they belittle and make light of God’s\nTrueFollowersObeyGod’sLaw,November4 607\nprecepts, if they break one of the least of these commandments, and\nteach men so, they shall be of no esteem in the sight of Heaven, and\nwe may know that their claims are without foundation.\nAnd the claim to be without sin is, in itself, evidence that he\nwho makes this claim is far from holy. It is because he has no true\nconception of the infinite purity and holiness of God or of what they [288]\nmust become who shall be in harmony with His character; because\nhe has no true conception of the purity and exalted loveliness of\nJesus, and the malignity and evil of sin, that man can regard himself\nas holy.\nIt was the righteousness revealed in His [Christ’s] life that dis-\ntinguished Him from the world."

His acts of disloyalty in making\nvoid the law of God are exposed to his sight, and his spirit is stricken\nand afflicted under the searching influences of the Spirit of God. He\nloathes himself as he views the greatness, the majesty, the pure and\nspotless character of Jesus Christ.\nWhen the Spirit of Christ stirs the heart with its marvelous awak-\nening power, there is a sense of deficiency in the soul, that leads\nto contrition of mind, and humiliation of self, rather than to proud\nboasting of what has been acquired. When Daniel beheld the glory\nand majesty surrounding the heavenly messenger that was sent unto\nhim, he exclaimed, as he described the wonderful scene, “Therefore\nI was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no\nstrength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption,\nand I retained no strength.”\nThe soul that is thus touched will never wrap itself about with\nself-righteousness, or a pretentious garb of holiness; but will hate\nits selfishness, abhor its self-love, and will seek, through Christ’s\nrighteousness, for that purity of heart which is in harmony with the\nlaw of God and the character of Christ.

He did it to demonstrate his\njustice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who\njustifies the man who has faith in Jesus. Romans 3:25, 26,\nN.I.V.\n“Being justified freely by his grace,” the apostle Paul says,\n“through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath\nset forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare\nhis righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the\nforbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness:\nthat he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in\nJesus.”\nHere the truth is laid out in plain lines. This mercy and goodness\nis wholly undeserved. The grace of Christ is freely to justify the\nsinner without merit or claim on his part. Justification is a full,\ncomplete pardon of sin. The moment a sinner accepts Christ by\nfaith, that moment he is pardoned. The righteousness of Christ is\nimputed to him, and he is no more to doubt God’s forgiving grace.\nThere is nothing in faith that makes it our saviour. Faith cannot\nremove our guilt. Christ is the power of God unto salvation to all\nthem that believe. The justification comes through the merits of\nJesus Christ. He has paid the price for the sinner’s redemption. Yet it\nis only through faith in His blood that Jesus can justify the believer.\nThe sinner cannot depend upon his own good works as a means\nof justification. He must come to the point where he will renounce\nall his sin, and embrace one degree of light after another, as it shines\nupon his pathway. He simply grasps by faith the free and ample\nprovision made in the blood of Christ. He believes the promises\nof God which through Christ are made unto him sanctification and\nrighteousness and redemption.\nJustifiedSoulsWalkInTheLight,November7 613\nAnd if he follows Jesus, he will walk humbly in the light, rejoic-\ning in the light, and diffusing that light to others.

The souls\nwho are in subordination to God, who honor Him, and are doers of [291]\nHis Word, will receive divine enlightenment. In the precious Word\nof God, there is purity and loftiness as well as beauty that, unless\nassisted by God, the highest powers of man cannot attain to....\nWe are none of us excusable, under any form of trial, for letting\nour hold upon God become loosened.

The existence and power of God, the truth of His Word, are\nfacts that even Satan and his hosts cannot at heart deny. The Bible\nsays that “the devils also believe, and tremble” (James 2:19); but\nthis is not faith. Where there is not only a belief in God’s Word, but\na submission of the will to Him; where the heart is yielded to Him,\nthe affections fixed upon Him, there is faith—faith that works by\nlove and purifies the soul.\nThrough this faith the heart is renewed in the image of God.

Even if we are overcome\nby the enemy, we are not cast off, not forsaken and rejected of God.\nNo; Christ is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession\nfor us. Said the beloved John, “These things write I unto you, that\nye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,\nJesus Christ the righteous” (1 John 2:1).\n[293] And do not forget the words of Christ, “the Father himself loveth\nyou” (John 16:27).

John calls upon the world to behold “what manner of\nWeAreToReflectChrist’sLove,November24 647\nlove the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the\nsons of God.” It is a love that passeth knowledge.\nIn the fullness of the sacrifice, nothing was withheld. Jesus gave\nHimself. God designs that His people shall love one another as\nChrist loved us. They are to educate and train the soul for this love.\nThey are to reflect this love in their own character, to reflect it to the\nworld. Each should look upon this as his work.... Christ’s fullness is\nto be presented to the world by those who have become partakers\nof His grace. They are to do that for Christ which Christ did for the\nFather—represent His character."

A noble character is\nearned by individual effort through the merits and grace and Christ.\nGod gives the talents, the powers of the mind; we form the character.\nIt is formed by hard, stern battles with self.

He spake as one having authority, and yet He\ninvites the confidence of all. “Come unto me, all ye that labour and\nare heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you,\nand learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find\nrest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light”\n(Matthew 11:28-30).\nThe only-begotten Son of the infinite God has, by His words, His\npractical example, left us a plain pattern which we are to copy. By\nHis words He has educated us to obey God, and by His own practice\nHe has showed us how we can obey God. This is the very work\nHe wants every man to do, to obey God intelligently, by precept\nand example teach others what they must do in order to be obedient\nchildren of God.\nJesus has helped the whole world to an intelligent knowledge of\nHis divine mission and work. He came to represent the character\nof the Father to our world, and as we study the life, the words, and\nworks of Jesus Christ, we are helped in every way in the education\nof obedience to God; and as we copy the example He has given us,\nwe are living epistles known and read of all men. We are the living\nhuman agencies to represent in character Jesus Christ to the world.\nNot only did Christ give explicit rules showing how we may\nbecome obedient children, but He showed us in His own life and\ncharacter just how to do those things which are right and acceptable\nwith God, so there is no excuse why we should not do those things\nwhich are pleasing in His sight....\nThe great Teacher came to our world to stand at the head of\nhumanity, to thus elevate and sanctify humanity by His holy obe-\nJesusShowedUsHowToLive,November26 651\ndience to all of God’s requirements, showing it is possible to obey\nall the commandments of God.

Often the gospel laborer carries on his work\namid storms of persecution, bitter opposition, and unjust reproach.\nAt such times let him remember that the experience to be gained in\nthe furnace of trial and affliction is worth all the pain it costs.

Isaiah\n35:10.\nThe world is full of men and women who manifest no sense of\nobligation to God for their entrusted gifts. They do not realize that\nGod has entrusted them with talents, not for self-glorification, but\nfor His own name’s glory. They are eager for distinction....\nThere are men whom God has qualified with more than ordinary\nability. Theyaredeepthinkers, energetic, andthorough. Butmanyof\nthem are bent upon the attainment of their own selfish ends, without\nregard to the honor and glory of God. Some of these have seen\nthe light of truth, but because they honored themselves, and did not\nmake God first and last and best in everything, they have wandered\naway from Bible truth into skepticism and infidelity. When these\nare arrested by the chastisements of God, and through affliction are\nled to inquire for the old paths, the mist of skepticism is swept from\ntheir minds. Some of them repent, return to the old love, and set\ntheir feet in the way cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk\nin. No longer are they actuated by the love of money or by selfish\nambition. The Spirit of God working upon the heart is valued by\nthem more highly than goldorthe praise ofmen.

They have no ambition for worldly fame.\nTheir will is subordinate to the will of God. The love of God inspires\ntheir ministry. To do good and to save souls is their highest aim.\nThese have gained genuine knowledge, even the knowledge set\nforth by Christ in the words, “This is life eternal, that they might\nknow thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent”\n(John 17:3).\n[313] God Has A Tender Care For His People, November\nThe eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are\nopen unto their cry.

I have no fears\nfor God’s cause. He will take care of His own cause. Our duty is to\nfill our lot and place, live...humble at the foot of the cross, and live\nfaithful, holy lives before Him.

The\ntrifler and scorner may grow bolder and harder in their iniquity. Yet,\nfor all this, we will not be moved. We have not run as uncertain. No,\nno. My heart is fixed, trusting in God. We have a whole Saviour. We\ncan rejoice in His rich fullness. I long to be more devoted to God,\nmore consecrated to Him. This world is too dark for me. Jesus said\nHe would go away and prepare mansions for us, that where He is\nwe may be also. Praise God for this. My heart leaps with joy at the\ncheering prospect.\nReligion is made to dwell too much in an iron case. Pure religion\nand undefiled leads us to a childlike simplicity.

As\nthe sun goes forth in the heavens, dispelling the shades of night, and\nfilling the world with brightness, so must the followers of Jesus let\ntheir light shine to dispel the moral darkness of a world lying in sin.\nBut they have no light of themselves; it is the light of Heaven which\nthey are to reflect to the world.\n“A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.” Our thoughts and\npurposes are the secret springs of action, and hence determine the\ncharacter. The purpose formed in the heart need not be expressed\nin word or deed in order to make it sin, and bring the soul into con-\ndemnation. Every thought, feeling, and inclination, though unseen\nby men, is discerned by the eye of God.

        "content": "Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in\nthe inheritance of the saints in light. Colossians 1:12, R.S.V.\nThe ransom has been paid, and it is possible for all to come to\nGod, and through a life of obedience to attain unto everlasting life.\nThen how sad it is that men turn from the immortal inheritance, and\nlive for the gratification of pride, for selfishness and display, and\n... lose the blessing which they might have both in this life and in\nthe life to come. They might enter into the palaces of heaven, and\nassociate on terms of freedom and equality with Christ and heavenly\nangels, and with the princes of God; and yet, incredible as it may\nseem, they turn from heavenly attractions.\nThe Creator of all worlds proposes to love those who believe in\nHis only-begotten Son as their personal Saviour, even as He loves\nHis Son. Even here and now His gracious favor is bestowed upon\nus to this marvelous extent. He has given to men the gift of the\nLight and Majesty of heaven, and with Him He has bestowed all\nthe treasures of heaven. Much as He has promised us for the life\nto come, He also bestows princely gifts upon us in this life, and as\nsubjects of His grace, He would have us enjoy everything that will\nennoble, expand, and elevate our characters. It is His design to fit us\nfor the heavenly courts above.\nBut Satan is contending for the souls of men.... He would not\nhave them catch a glimpse of the future honor, the eternal glories,\nlaid up for those who shall be inhabitants of heaven, or have a taste\n[342] of the experience that gives a foretaste of the happiness of heaven....\nThose who accept Christ as their Saviour have the promise of the\nlife that now is, and that which is to come.... The lowliest disciple\nof Christ may become an inhabitant of heaven, an heir of God to\nan inheritance incorruptible, and that fadeth not away. O that every\none might make choice of the heavenly gift, become an heir of\nGod to that inheritance whose title is secure from any destroyer,\nImmortalInheritance,December30 721\nworld without end! O, choose not the world, but choose the better\ninheritance! Press, urge your way toward the mark for the prize of\nyour high calling in Christ Jesus."

        "content": "Foreword\nThis is the sixteenth “Morning-Watch”-type book compiled from\nthe writings of Ellen G. White. The first in this long series, Radiant\nReligion, was published in 1946 for use the following year. It was\nfollowed three years later by With God at Dawn. The materials for\nthese two early devotional works were drawn entirely from Ellen G.\nWhite books already in print.\nBeginning with My Life Today, published in 1952, recourse has\nbeen made consistently to the wealth of previously unpublished\nmaterials in the Ellen G. White manuscript and letter file. Titles\npublished, with the year of publication, are as follows:\n—Radiant Religion, 1946\n—With God at Dawn, 1949\n—My Life Today, 1952\n—Sons and Daughters of God, 1955\n—The Faith I Live By, 1958\n—Our High Calling, 1961\n—That I May Know Him, 1964\n—In Heavenly Places, 1967\n—Conflict and Courage, 1970\n—God’s Amazing Grace, 1973\n—Maranatha, 1976\n—This Day with God, 1979\n—The Upward Look, 1982\n—Reflecting Christ, 1985\n—Lift Him Up, 1988\nThe records of the Review and Herald Publishing Company\nAssociation reveal a steadily increasing sale of these books over the\nyears. In the 1950s My Life Today sold 24,000 copies, while Sons\nand Daughters of God had a sale of 33,000. In the 1960s both That I\nMay Know Him and In Heavenly Places had sales exceeding 63,000\ncopies. These figures have escalated to sales of more than 90,000 for\nseveral of the more recent devotional books. Many of these books\nxxiv\nForeword xxv\nhave also enjoyed a large sale in Spanish, Portuguese, and Korean,\nand other non-English Languages.\nA sampling of opinion among church members reveals that the\nrich materials published in the earlier devotionals are largely un-\nknown to many Adventists today. This present book has been pub-\nlished to remedy this situation. It consists of selections from 12 of\nthe books named above—one book a month for the 12 months of [6]\n1992. The source book for each chapter can be located by referring\nto the title of each chapter.\nEllen White states that “Christ’s favorite theme was the paternal\ncharacter and abundant love of God” (Testimonies for the Church\n6:55). This also seems to be Ellen White’s favorite theme. For that\nreason the compilers have chosen the title Our Father Cares. The\ntitle has a double significance. Not only have readings been selected\non the topic of God’s great love and care for us, but they also reflect\nthe fact that God cares so much for us that He is interested in every\naspect of our daily lives. He cares about our health, our homes, our\nstudy of His Word, our victory over sin, our preparation for His\nsecond coming. He also longs for us to be with Him in His kingdom,\nwhich is soon to be established on earth. How much He cares!\nWe invite you to read each day’s devotional with both aspects\nof God’s concern in mind, trusting that as you meditate on each\npassage you will come to appreciate more than ever how much God\nloves and cares for you.\nThe Trustees of the Ellen G. White Estate\nxxvi OurFatherCares\nJanuary—Sons and Daughters of God"
