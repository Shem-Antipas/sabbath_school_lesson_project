Romans 15:4, Phillips.\n\nThe lives recorded in the Bible are authentic histories of actual\n\nindividuals. From Adam down through successive generations to the\n\ntimes of the apostles we have a plain, unvarnished account of what\n\nactually occurred and the genuine experience of real characters. It is\n\na subject of wonder to many that inspired history should narrate in\n\nthe lives of good men facts that tarnish their moral characters....

Genesis 2:18.\n\nAfter the creation of Adam every living creature was brought\n\nbefore him to receive its name; he saw that to each had been given\n\na companion, but among them “there was not found an help meet\n\nfor him.” Among all the creatures that God had made on the earth,\n\nthere was not one equal to man. And God said, “It is not good\n\nthat the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for\n\nhim.” Man was not made to dwell in solitude; he was to be a social\n\nbeing. Without companionship the beautiful scenes and delightful\n\nemployments of Eden would have failed to yield perfect happiness.\n\nEven communion with angels could not have satisfied his desire for\n\nsympathy and companionship. There was none of the same nature\n\nto love and to be loved.\n\nGod Himself gave Adam a companion. He provided “an help\n\nmeet for him”—a helper corresponding to him—one who was fitted\n\nto be his companion, and who could be one with him in love and\n\nsympathy. Eve was created from a rib taken from the side of Adam,\n\nsignifying that she was not to control him as the head, nor to be\n\ntrampled under his feet as an inferior, but to stand by his side as an\n\nequal, to be loved and protected by him. A part of man, bone of his\n\nbone, and flesh of his flesh, she was his second self; showing the\n\nclose union and the affectionate attachment that should exist in this\n\nrelation. “For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth\n\nand cherisheth it” (Ephesians 5:29). “Therefore shall a man leave\n\nhis father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they\n\nshall be one” (Genesis 2:24).\n\nGod celebrated the first marriage.

Communing thus with God, Enoch came more and more\n\nto reflect the divine image. His face was radiant with a holy light,\n\neven the light that shineth in the face of Jesus. As he came forth\n\nfrom these divine communings, even the ungodly beheld with awe\n\nthe impress of heaven upon his countenance.41\n\nEnoch kept the Lord ever before him.... He made Christ his con-\n\nstant companion. He was in the world, and performed his duties to\n\nthe world; but he was ever under the influence of Jesus. He reflected\n\nChrist’s character, exhibiting the same qualities of goodness, mercy,\n\ntender compassion, sympathy, forbearance, meekness, humility, and\n\nlove. His association with Christ day by day transformed him into\n\nthe image of Him with whom he was so intimately connected. Day\n\nby day he was growing away from his own way into Christ’s way,\n\nthe heavenly, the divine, in his thoughts and feelings.42\n\nIf we keep the Lord ever before us, allowing our hearts to go\n\nout in thanksgiving and praise to Him, we shall have a continual\n\nfreshness in our religious life.

As their numbers increased,\n\napostasy soon led to division. Those who desired to forget their Cre-\n\nator and to cast off the restraint of His law felt a constant annoyance\n\nfrom the teaching and example of their God-fearing associates, and\n\nafter a time they decided to separate from the worshipers of God.\n\nAccordingly they journeyed to the plain of Shinar, on the banks of\n\nthe river Euphrates.... Here they decided to build a city, and in it a\n\ntower of such stupendous height as should render it the wonder of\n\nthe world....\n\nThe dwellers on the plain of Shinar disbelieved God’s covenant\n\nthat He would not again bring a flood upon the earth. Many of them\n\ndenied the existence of God and attributed the Flood to the operation\n\nof natural causes. Others believed in a Supreme Being, and that it\n\nwas He who had destroyed the antediluvian world; and their hearts,\n\nlike that of Cain, rose up in rebellion against Him. One object before\n\nthem in the erection of the tower was to secure their own safety in\n\ncase of another deluge. By carrying the structure to a much greater\n\nheight than was reached by the waters of the Flood, they thought\n\nto place themselves beyond all possibility of danger.

Genesis 28:12.\n\nThreatenedwith deathby the wrathofEsau, Jacobwent outfrom\n\nhis father’s home a fugitive; but he carried with him the father’s\n\nblessing; Isaac had renewed to him the covenant promise, and had\n\nbidden him, as its inheritor, to seek a wife of his mother’s family in\n\nMesopotamia. Yet it was with a deeply troubled heart that Jacob set\n\nout on his lonely journey. With only his staff in his hand he must\n\ntravel hundreds of miles through a country inhabited by wild, roving\n\ntribes. In his remorse and timidity he sought to avoid men, lest he\n\nshould be traced by his angry brother. He feared that he had lost\n\nforever the blessing that God had purposed to give him; and Satan\n\nwas at hand to press temptations upon him....\n\nThe darkness of despair pressed upon his soul, and he hardly\n\ndared to pray. But he was so utterly lonely that he felt the need of\n\nprotection from God as he had never felt it before. With weeping\n\nand deep humiliation he confessed his sin, and entreated for some\n\nevidence that he was not utterly forsaken.... God did not forsake\n\nJacob. His mercy was still extended to His erring, distrustful ser-\n\nvant. The Lord compassionately revealed just what Jacob needed—a\n\nSaviour....\n\nWearied with his journey, the wanderer lay down upon the\n\nground, with a stone for his pillow. As he slept he beheld a ladder,\n\nbright and shining, whose base rested upon the earth, while the top\n\nreached to heaven. Upon this ladder angels were ascending and\n\ndescending; above it was the Lord of glory....\n\nJacob awoke from his sleep in the deep stillness of night. The\n\nshining forms of his vision had disappeared. Only the dim outline\n\n133\n\n134 ConflictandCourage\n\nof the lonely hills, and above them the heavens bright with stars,\n\nnow met his gaze. But he had a solemn sense that God was with\n\nhim. An unseen presence filled the solitude. “Surely the Lord is in\n\nthis place,” he said, “and I knew it not.... This is none other but the\n\nhouse of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”55"

With deep gratitude he repeated the promise that God’s\n\npresence would be with him; and then he made the solemn vow, “If\n\nGod will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will\n\ngive me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to\n\nmy father’s house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God: and this\n\nstone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all\n\nthat thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth upon thee.”\n\nJacob was not here seeking to make terms with God. The Lord\n\nhad already promised him prosperity, and this vow was the outflow\n\nof a heart filled with gratitude for the assurance of God’s love and\n\nmercy.

Genesis\n\n29:20.\n\nHow different his [Jacob’s] arrival from that of Abraham’s mes-\n\nsenger nearly a hundred years before! The servant had come with a\n\ntrain of attendants riding upon camels, and with rich gifts of gold\n\nand silver; the son was a lonely, footsore traveler, with no possession\n\nsave his staff. Like Abraham’s servant, Jacob tarried beside a well,\n\nand it was here that he met Rachel, Laban’s younger daughter....\n\nThough he came portionless and unattended, a few weeks showed\n\nthe worth of his diligence and skill, and he was urged to tarry. It was\n\narranged that he should render Laban seven years’ service for the\n\nhand of Rachel.\n\nIn early times custom required the bridegroom, before the rat-\n\nification of a marriage engagement, to pay a sum of money or its\n\nequivalent in other property, according to his circumstances, to the\n\nfather of his wife. This was regarded as a safeguard to the marriage\n\nrelation.... But provision was made to test those who had nothing to\n\npay for a wife. They were permitted to labor for the father whose\n\ndaughter they loved, the length of time being regulated by the value\n\nof the dowry required. When the suitor was faithful in his services,\n\nand proved in other respects worthy, he obtained the daughter as his\n\nwife; and generally the dowry which the father had received was\n\ngiven her at her marriage....\n\nThe ancient custom, though sometimes abused, as by Laban,\n\nwas productive of good results. When the suitor was required to\n\nrender service to secure his bride, a hasty marriage was prevented,\n\nand there was opportunity to test the depth of his affections, as well\n\nas his ability to provide for a family.

Exodus 3:10.\n\nThe time for Israel’s deliverance had come. But God’s purpose\n\nwas to be accomplished in a manner to pour contempt on human\n\npride. The deliverer was to go forth as a humble shepherd, with only\n\na rod in his hand; but God would make that rod the symbol of His\n\npower....\n\nThe divine command given to Moses found him self-distrustful,\n\nslow of speech, and timid. He was overwhelmed with a sense of his\n\nincapacity to be a mouthpiece for God to Israel. But having once\n\naccepted the work, he entered upon it with his whole heart, putting\n\nall his trust in the Lord.... God blessed his ready obedience, and\n\nhe became eloquent, hopeful, self-possessed, and well fitted for the\n\ngreatest work ever given to man. This is an example of what God\n\ndoes to strengthen the character of those who trust Him fully and\n\ngive themselves unreservedly to His commands.\n\nA man will gain power and efficiency as he accepts the responsi-\n\nbilities that God places upon him, and with his whole soul seeks to\n\nqualify himself to bear them aright. However humble his position or\n\nlimited his ability, that man will attain true greatness who, trusting\n\nto divine strength, seeks to perform his work with fidelity....\n\nOn the way from Midian, Moses received a startling and terrible\n\nwarning of the Lord’s displeasure. An angel appeared to him in a\n\nthreatening manner, as if he would immediately destroy him. No ex-\n\nplanation was given; butMoses rememberedthathe had... neglected\n\nto perform the rite of circumcision upon their youngest son.... In his\n\nmission to Pharaoh, Moses was to be placed in a position of great\n\nperil; his life could be preserved only through the protection of holy\n\n180\n\nGodSentHim,March 22 181\n\nangels. But while living in neglect of a known duty, he would not be\n\nsecure; for he could not be shielded by the angels of God.\n\nIn the time of trouble just before the coming of Christ, the righ-\n\nteous will be preserved through the ministration of heavenly angels;\n\nbut there will be no security for the transgressor of God’s law.

The\n\nLord accepted their repentance, though because of the harm their sin\n\nmight do among the people, He could not remit its punishment....\n\nGod had forgiven the people greater transgressions, but He could\n\nnot deal with sin in the leaders as in those who were led. He had\n\nhonored Moses above every other man upon the earth.... The fact\n\nthat Moses had enjoyed so great light and knowledge made his sin\n\nmore grievous. Past faithfulness will not atone for one wrong act.\n\nThe greater the light and privileges granted to man, the greater is his\n\nresponsibility, the more aggravated his failure, and the heavier his\n\npunishment.\n\nMoses was not guilty of a great crime, as men would view the\n\nmatter.... But if God dealt so severely with this sin in His most\n\nfaithful and honored servant, He will not excuse it in others.... All\n\nwho profess godliness are under the most sacred obligation to guard\n\nthe spirit, and to exercise self-control under the greatest provocation.\n\nThe burdens placed upon Moses were very great; few men will\n\never be so severely tried as he was; yet this was not allowed to\n\nexcuse his sin. God has made ample provision for His people; and\n\nif they rely upon His strength, they will never become the sport of\n\ncircumstances. Thestrongesttemptationcannotexcusesin.

He could not grant the prayer of Moses that\n\nhe might share the inheritance of Israel, but He did not forget or\n\nforsake His servant. The God of heaven understood the suffering\n\nthat Moses had endured; He had noted every act of faithful service\n\nthrough those long years of conflict and trial.

Then, when his sin could\n\nno longer be concealed, he admitted the truth. How often are similar\n\nconfessions made. There is a vast difference between admitting\n\nfacts after they have been proved and confessing sins known only\n\nto ourselves and to God.

The ambassadors repre-\n\nsented that they had come from a distant country, and this seemed\n\nto be confirmed by their appearance. Their clothing was old and\n\nworn, their sandals were patched, their provisions moldy, and the\n\nskins that served them for wine bottles were rent and bound up, as if\n\nhastily repaired on the journey....\n\nThese representations prevailed.... “And Joshua made peace with\n\nthem, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes\n\nof the congregation sware unto them.” Thus the treaty was entered\n\ninto....\n\nBut it would have fared better with the Gibeonites had they dealt\n\nhonestly with Israel.

God had made provision that all who would\n\nrenounce heathenism, and connect themselves with Israel, should\n\nshare the blessings of the covenant. They were included under\n\nthe term, “the stranger that sojourneth among you,” and with few\n\nexceptions this class were to enjoy equal favors and privileges with\n\nIsrael. The Lord’s direction was—“If a stranger sojourn with thee in\n\nyour land, ye shall not vex him. But the stranger that dwelleth with\n\nyou shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love\n\nhim as thyself” (Leviticus 19:33, 34)....\n\nSuch was the footing on which the Gibeonites might have been\n\nreceived, but for the deception to which they had resorted.

ExceptJoshua, Calebwas now the oldestman in Israel. Caleb\n\nand Joshua were the only ones among the spies who had brought a\n\ngood report of the Land of Promise, encouraging the people to go up\n\nand possess it in the name of the Lord. Caleb now reminded Joshua\n\nof the promise then made, as the reward of his faithfulness: “The\n\nland whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and\n\nthy children’s forever, because thou hast wholly followed the Lord.”\n\nHe therefore presented a request that Hebron be given him for a\n\npossession.... His claim was immediately granted.

He had believed God’s\n\npromise that He would put His people in possession of Canaan,\n\nand in this he had followed the Lord fully. He had endured with\n\nhis people the long wandering in the wilderness, thus sharing the\n\ndisappointments andburdens ofthe guilty; yethe made no complaint\n\nof this, but exalted the mercy of God that had preserved him in the\n\nwilderness when his brethren were cut off.... The brave old warrior\n\nwas desirous of giving to the people an example that would honor\n\nGod, and encourage the tribes fully to subdue the land which their\n\nfathers had deemed unconquerable. Caleb obtained the inheritance\n\nupon which his heart had been set for forty years, and, trusting in\n\nGod to be with him, he “drove thence the three sons of Anak.” ...\n\nThe cowards and rebels had perished in the wilderness, but the\n\nrighteous spies ate of the grapes of Eshcol.

It was presented by the\n\nchildren of Joseph, the tribe of Ephraim with the half tribe of Man-\n\nasseh. In consideration of their superior numbers, these tribes de-\n\nmanded a double portion of territory. The lot designated for them\n\nwas the richest in the land, including the fertile plain of Sharon; but\n\nmany of the principal towns in the valley were still in possession\n\nof the Canaanites, and the tribes shrank from the toil and danger\n\nof conquering their possessions, and desired an additional portion\n\nin territory already subdued. The tribe of Ephraim was one of the\n\nlargestin Israel, as wellas theonetowhichJoshuahimselfbelonged,\n\nand its members naturally regarded themselves as entitled to special\n\nconsideration. “Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion\n\nto inherit,” they said, “seeing I am a great people?” But no departure\n\nfrom strict justice could be won from the inflexible leader.\n\nHis answer was, “If thou be a great people, then get thee up to\n\nthe wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the\n\nPerizzites and of the giants, if Mount Ephraim be too narrow for\n\nthee.”\n\nTheir reply showed the real cause of complaint. They lacked\n\nfaith andcourage to drive outthe Canaanites. “The hill is not enough\n\nfor us,” they said; “and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of\n\nthe valley have chariots of iron.”\n\nThe power of the God of Israel had been pledged to His people,\n\nand had the Ephraimites possessed the courage and faith of Caleb,\n\nno enemy could have stood before them. Their evident desire to\n\n256\n\nIronChariots,April 28 257\n\nshun hardship and danger was firmly met by Joshua. “Thou art a\n\ngreat people, and hast great power,” he said; “Thou shalt drive out\n\nthe Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be\n\nstrong.” Thus their own arguments were turned against them. Being\n\na great people, as they claimed, they were fully able to make their\n\nown way, as did their brethren. With the help of God they need not\n\nfear the chariots of iron.42"

He had been placed under the care of Eli in his youth,\n\nand the loveliness of his character drew forth the warm affection\n\nof the aged priest.

The contrast between the course of the youth Samuel and\n\nthat of the priest’s own sons was very marked, and Eli found rest and\n\ncomfort and blessing in the presence of his charge. It was a singular\n\nthing that between Eli, the chief magistrate of the nation, and the\n\nsimple child so warm a friendship should exist. Samuel was helpful\n\nand affectionate, and no father ever loved his child more tenderly\n\nthan did Eli this youth. As the infirmities of age came upon Eli, he\n\nfelt more keenly the disheartening, reckless, profligate course of his\n\nown sons, and he turned to Samuel for comfort and support.\n\nHow touching to see youth and old age relying one upon the\n\nother, the youth looking up to the aged for counsel and wisdom,\n\n297\n\n298 ConflictandCourage\n\nthe aged looking to the youth for help and sympathy.

To his own authority was added that of\n\nthe prophet, and at the call to battle the men of Israel flocked to\n\nhis standard.

He could account for it only by the belief\n\nthat there had been traitors in his camp, who had informed the son\n\nof Jesse of his proximity and design.\n\nHe affirmed to his counselors that a conspiracy had been formed\n\nagainst him, and with the offer of rich gifts and positions of honor he\n\nbribed them to reveal who among his people had befriended David.\n\nDoeg the Edomite turned informer. Moved by ambition and avarice,\n\nand by hatred of the priest, who had reproved his sins, Doeg reported\n\nDavid’s visit to Ahimelech, representing the matter in such a light\n\nas to kindle Saul’s anger against the man of God. The words of\n\nthat mischievous tongue, set on fire of hell, stirred up the worst\n\npassions in Saul’s heart. Maddened with rage, he declared that the\n\nwhole family of the priest should perish. And the terrible decree\n\nwas executed. Not only Ahimelech, but the members of his father’s\n\nhouse ... were slain at the king’s command, by the murderous hand\n\nof Doeg....\n\nThis is what Saul could do under the control of Satan. When\n\nGod had said that the iniquity of the Amalekites was full, and had\n\ncommanded him to destroy them utterly, he thought himself too\n\ncompassionate to execute the divine sentence, and he spared that\n\n343\n\n344 ConflictandCourage\n\nwhich was devoted to destruction; but now, without a command\n\nfrom God, under the guidance of Satan, he could slay the priests\n\nof the Lord and bring ruin upon the inhabitants of Nob.

It tended to lower the standard of godliness in Israel,\n\nto lessen in many minds the abhorrence of sin; while those who did\n\nnot love and fear God were by it emboldened in transgression.\n\nNathan the prophet was bidden to bear a message of reproof to\n\nDavid.

Such a one will learn from the Great Teacher\n\nnot only what to do, but how to do it in a way that will meet with\n\nthe divine approval.\n\nSo long as he remains consecrated, the man whom God has en-\n\ndowed with discernment and ability will not manifest an eagerness\n\nfor high position, neither will he seek to rule or control. Of neces-\n\nsity men must bear responsibilities; but instead of striving for the\n\nsupremacy, he who is a true leader will pray for an understanding\n\nheart, to discern between good and evil.\n\nThe path of men who are placed as leaders is not an easy one.\n\nBut they are to see in every difficulty a call to prayer. Never are they\n\nto fail of consulting the great Source of all wisdom. Strengthened\n\nand enlightened by the Master Worker, they will be enabled to stand\n\nfirm against unholy influences and to discern right from wrong, good\n\nfrom evil. They will approve that which God approves, and will\n\nstrive earnestly against the introduction of wrong principles into His\n\ncause. The wisdom that Solomon desired above riches, honor, or\n\nlong life, God gave him. His petition for a quick mind, a large heart,\n\nand a tender spirit was granted.8\n\nIt would be well for us carefully to study Solomon’s prayer, and\n\nto consider every point on which depended his receiving the rich\n\nblessings that the Lord was ready to give him.9\n\n390\n\nWisdomfortheAsking,July 3 391\n\nGod commended Solomon’s prayer. And He will today hear and\n\ncommend the prayers of those who in faith and humility cry to Him\n\nfor aid. He will certainly answer the fervent prayer for a preparation\n\nfor service. In answer He will say, Here I am. What wilt thou that\n\nI shall do for thee? ...

In the proverbs of Solomon are\n\noutlined principles of holy living and high endeavor, principles that\n\nare heaven-born and that lead to godliness, principles that should\n\ngovern every act of life.

The hand\n\noutstretched against the messenger of Jehovah suddenly became\n\npowerless and withered, and could not be withdrawn.\n\nTerror-stricken, the king appealed to the prophet to intercede\n\nwith God in his behalf.... “And the man of God besought the Lord,\n\nand the king’s hand was restored him again, and became as it was\n\nbefore.”\n\nVain had been Jeroboam’s effort to invest with solemnity the\n\ndedication of a strange altar, respect for which would have led to\n\ndisrespect for the worship of Jehovah in the temple at Jerusalem. By\n\nthe message of the prophet, the king of Israel should have been led\n\nto repent and to renounce his wicked purposes, which were turning\n\nthe people away from the true worship of God. But he hardened his\n\nheart and determined to follow a way of his own choosing....\n\nThe Lord seeks to save, not to destroy.

Lamentations 3:26.\n\nAmong those who had hoped for a permanent spiritual revival\n\nas the result of the reformation under Josiah was Jeremiah, called of\n\nGod to the prophetic office while still a youth....\n\nIn the youthful Jeremiah, God saw one who would be true to his\n\ntrust and who would stand for the right against great opposition....\n\n“Say not, I am a child,” the Lord bade His chosen messenger; “for\n\nthou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command\n\nthee thou shalt speak. Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee\n\nto deliver thee.” ...\n\nFor forty years Jeremiah was to stand before the nation as a wit-\n\nness for truth and righteousness. In a time of unparalleled apostasy\n\nhe was to exemplify in life and character the worship of the only\n\ntrue God. During the terrible sieges of Jerusalem he was to be the\n\nmouthpiece of Jehovah.27\n\nNaturally of a timid and shrinking disposition, Jeremiah longed\n\nfor the peace and quite of a life of retirement, where he need not\n\nwitness the continued impenitence of his beloved nation. His heart\n\nwas wrung with anguish over the ruin wrought by sin....\n\nThe experiences through which Jeremiah passed in the days of\n\nhis youth and also in the later years of his ministry, taught him the\n\nlesson that “the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that\n\nwalketh to direct his steps.” He learned to pray, “O Lord, correct me,\n\nbut with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing”\n\n(Jeremiah 10:23, 24).\n\nWhen called to drink of the cup of tribulation and sorrow, and\n\nwhen tempted in his misery to say, “My strength and my hope is\n\nperished from the Lord,” he recalled the providences of God in his\n\nbehalf and triumphantly exclaimed, “It is of the Lord’s mercies that\n\n485\n\n486 ConflictandCourage\n\nwe are not consumed, because his compassions fail not....

The Rechabites were commended for their ready and\n\nwilling obedience, while God’s people refused to be reproved by\n\ntheir prophets.29\n\nIf the requirements of a good and wise father, who took the\n\nbest and most effectual means to secure his posterity against the\n\nevils of intemperance, were worthy of strict obedience, surely God’s\n\nauthority should be held in as much greater reverence as He is\n\nholier than man.

It shows us that through religious principle young men\n\nmay triumph over the lusts of the flesh, and remain true to God’s\n\nrequirements, even though it costs them a great sacrifice.\n\nWhat if Daniel and his companions had made a compromise\n\nwith those heathen officers, and had yielded to the pressure of the\n\noccasion, by eating and drinking as was customary with the Babylo-\n\nnians? That single instance of departure from principle would have\n\nweakened their sense of right and their abhorrence of wrong. Indul-\n\ngence of appetite would have invoked the sacrifice of physical vigor,\n\nclearness of intellect, and spiritual power. One wrong step would\n\nprobably have led to others, until, their connection with Heaven\n\nbeing severed, they would have been swept away by temptation....\n\nWhile Daniel clung to his God with unwavering trust, the spirit\n\nof prophetic power came upon him. While he was instructed of man\n\nin the duties of court life, he was taught of God to read the mysteries\n\nof future ages, and to present to coming generations, through figures\n\nand similitudes, the wonderful things that would come to pass in the\n\nlast days.49\n\nGod designed that man should be constantly improving, daily\n\nreaching a higher point in the scale of excellence. He will help us,\n\nif we seek to help ourselves. Our hope of happiness in two worlds\n\ndepends upon our improvement in one. At every point we should be\n\nguarded against the first approach to intemperance.\n\nDear youth, God calls upon you to do a work which through His\n\ngrace you can do.... Show a purity of tastes, appetite, and habits that\n\nbears comparison with Daniel’s.

Ezra 7:10.\n\nBorn of the sons of Aaron, Ezra had been given a priestly train-\n\ning; and in addition to this he had acquired a familiarity with the\n\nwritings of the magicians, the astrologers, and the wise men of the\n\nMedo-Persian realm. But he was not satisfied with his spiritual\n\ncondition. He longed to be in full harmony with God; he longed for\n\nwisdom to carry out the divine will.... This led him to apply himself\n\ndiligently to a study of the history of God’s people, as recorded in\n\nthe writings of prophets and kings. He searched the historical and\n\npoetical books of the Bible to learn why the Lord had permitted\n\nJerusalem to be destroyed and His people carried captive into a\n\nheathen land....\n\nHe studied the instruction given at Mount Sinai and through\n\nthe long period of wilderness wandering. As he learned more and\n\nstill more concerning God’s dealings with His children, and com-\n\nprehended the sacredness of the law given at Sinai, Ezra’s heart\n\nwas stirred. He experienced a new and thorough conversion and\n\ndetermined to master the records of sacred history, that he might use\n\nthis knowledge to bring blessing and light to his people.\n\nEzra endeavored to gain a heart preparation for the work he\n\nbelieved was before him. He sought God earnestly, that he might\n\nbe a wise teacher in Israel. As he learned to yield mind and will to\n\ndivine control, there were brought into his life the principles of true\n\nsanctification, which, in later years, had a molding influence, not\n\nonly upon the youth who sought his instruction, but upon all others\n\nassociated with Him....\n\nEzra became a mouthpiece for God, educating those about him\n\nin the principles that govern heaven....

As he communicated to others the truths he learned, his\n\n529\n\n530 ConflictandCourage\n\ncapacity for labor increased. He became a man of piety and zeal. He\n\nwas the Lord’s witness to the world of the power of Bible truth to\n\nennoble the daily life.16"

And is it not thus that angels\n\nof heaven survey the condition of the church of Christ?

But how\n\nare these evils regarded by beings divinely illuminated? Do not they,\n\nlike Nehemiah, look with sorrow-burdened heart upon ruined walls,\n\nand gates burned with fire?22\n\nNehemiah bore a royal commission requiring the inhabitants to\n\ncooperate with him in rebuilding the walls of the city, but he did\n\nnot depend upon the exercise of authority. He sought rather to gain\n\nthe confidence and sympathy of the people, knowing that a union\n\nof hearts as well as of hands was essential in the great work before\n\nhim.23\n\nThere is need of Nehemiahs in the church today,—not men who\n\ncan pray and preach only, but men whose prayers and sermons\n\nare braced with firm and eager purpose.... The success attending\n\nNehemiah’s efforts shows what prayer, faith, and wise, energetic\n\naction will accomplish.... The spirit manifested by the leader will be,\n\nto a great extent, reflected by the people. If the leaders professing\n\nto believe the solemn, important truths that are to test the world at\n\nthis time, manifest no ardent zeal to prepare a people to stand in the\n\nday of God, we must expect the church to be careless, indolent, and\n\npleasure-loving.24\n\nNehemiah was a reformer, a great man raised up foran important\n\ntime.

Deuteronomy 15:7, 8.\n\nAt times following the return of the exiles from Babylon, the\n\nwealthy Jews had gone directly contrary to these commands. When\n\nthe poor were obliged to borrow to pay tribute to the king, the\n\nwealthy had lent them money, but had exacted a high rate of interest.\n\nBy taking mortgages on the lands of the poor, they had gradually\n\nreduced the unfortunate debtors to the deepest poverty. Many had\n\nbeen forced to sell their sons and daughters into servitude; and there\n\nseemed no hope of improving their condition, no way to redeem\n\neither their children or their lands, no prospect before them but ever-\n\nincreasing distress, with perpetual want and bondage. Yet they were\n\nof the same nation, children of the same covenant, as their more\n\nfavored brethren....\n\nAs Nehemiah heard of this cruel oppression, his soul was filled\n\nwith indignation.... He saw that if he succeeded in breaking up\n\nthe oppressive custom of exaction he must take a decided stand for\n\njustice. With characteristic energy and determination he went to\n\nwork to bring relief to his brethren.\n\nThe fact that the oppressors were men of wealth, whose support\n\nwas greatly needed in the work of restoring the city, did not for a\n\nmoment influence Nehemiah. He sharply rebuked the nobles and\n\nrulers, and when he had gathered a great assembly of the people he\n\nset before them the requirements of God touching the case....\n\nThis record teaches an important lesson. “The love of money is\n\ntherootofallevil”(1 Timothy 6:10).

John was the son of their old age, he was a child of\n\nmiracle, and the parents might have reasoned that he had a special\n\nwork to do for the Lord and the Lord would take care of him. But\n\nthe parents did not thus reason; they moved to a retired place in the\n\ncountry, where their son would not be exposed to the temptations\n\nof city life, or induced to depart from the counsel and instruction\n\nwhich they as parents would give him.33\n\nIn the wilderness, John could the more readily deny himself and\n\nbring his appetite under control, and dress in accordance to natural\n\nsimplicity. And there was nothing in the wilderness that would take\n\nhis mind from meditation and prayer. Satan had access to John,\n\neven after he had closed every avenue in his power through which\n\nhe would enter. But his habits of life were so pure and natural that\n\nhe could discern the foe, and had strength of spirit and decision of\n\ncharacter to resist him.\n\nThe book of nature was open before John with its inexhaustible\n\nstore of varied instruction. He sought the favor of God, and the\n\n551\n\n552 ConflictandCourage\n\nHoly Spirit rested upon him, and kindled in his heart a glowing zeal\n\nto do the great work of calling the people to repentance, and to a\n\nhigher and holier life. John was fitting himself, by the privations\n\nand hardships of his secluded life, to so control all his physical and\n\nmental powers that he could stand among the people as unmoved\n\nby surrounding circumstances as the rocks and mountains of the\n\nwilderness that had surrounded him for thirty years.34"

While he was there, Philip came\n\nand said, “We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the\n\nprophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” But the\n\nword “Nazareth” again aroused his unbelief, and he said, “Can there\n\nany good thing come out of Nazareth?” He was full of prejudice, but\n\nPhilip did not seek to combat his prejudice; he simply said, “Come\n\nand see.” ...\n\nWould it not be well for us to go under the fig tree to plead\n\nwith God as to what is truth? Would not the eye of God be upon\n\nus as it was upon Nathanael?

Jesus commended the trusting faith of\n\nNathanael.\n\nThere are many in the same condition as was Nathanael. They\n\nare prejudiced and unbelieving because they have never come in\n\ncontact with the special truths for these last days or with the people\n\n574\n\nUndertheFigTree,October 2 575\n\nwho hold them, and it will require but attendance upon a meeting\n\nfull of the Spirit of Christ to sweep away their unbelief. No matter\n\nwhat we have to meet, what opposition, what effort to turn souls\n\naway from the truth of heavenly origin, we must give publicity to\n\nour faith, that honest souls may see and hear and be convinced for\n\nthemselves.

The Saviour\n\ndid not despise education; for when controlled by the love of God,\n\nand devoted to His service, intellectual culture is a blessing. But\n\nHe passed by the wise men of His time, because they were so self-\n\nconfident that they could not sympathize with suffering humanity,\n\nand become colaborers with the man of Nazareth. In their bigotry\n\nthey scorned to be taught by Christ. The Lord Jesus seeks the co-\n\noperation of those who will become unobstructed channels for the\n\ncommunion of His grace....\n\nJesus chose unlearned fishermen because they had not been\n\nschooled in the traditions and erroneous customs of their time. They\n\nwere men of native ability, and they were humble and teachable,—\n\nmen whom He could educate for His work. In the common walks\n\nof life there is many a man patiently treading the round of daily\n\ntoil, unconscious that he possesses powers which, if called into\n\naction, would raise him to an equality with the world’s most honored\n\nmen. The touch of a skillful hand is needed to arouse those dormant\n\nfaculties. It was such men that Jesus called to be His colaborers;\n\nand He gave them the advantage of association with Himself. Never\n\nhad the world’s great men such a teacher. When the disciples came\n\nforth from the Saviour’s training, they were no longer ignorant and\n\nuncultured. They had become like Him in mind and character, and\n\nmen took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus.4\n\nHe who called the fishermen of Galilee is still calling men to His\n\nservice.

The fact that the taxes were imposed by a foreign\n\npower was a continual irritation to the Jews, being a reminder that\n\ntheir independence had departed. And the taxgatherers were ... ex-\n\ntortioners on their own account, enriching themselves at the expense\n\nof the people.

John 3:21.\n\nNicodemus had come to the Lord thinking to enter into a discus-\n\nsion with Him, but Jesus laid bare the foundation principles of truth.\n\nHe said to Nicodemus, It is not theoretical knowledge you need so\n\nmuch as spiritual regeneration. You need not to have your curiosity\n\nsatisfied, but to have a new heart....\n\nHe [Nicodemus] saw that the most rigid obedience to the mere\n\nletter of the law as applied to the outward life could entitle no man\n\nto enter the kingdom of heaven. In the estimation of men, his life\n\nhad been just and honorable; but in the presence of Christ he felt\n\nthat his heart was unclean, and his life unholy.... As the Saviour\n\nexplained to him concerning the new birth, he longed to have this\n\nchange wroughtin himself.... Jesus answeredthe unspoken question:\n\n“As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the\n\nSon of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in Him should\n\nnot perish, but have eternal life.” ...\n\nNicodemus received the lesson, and carried it with him. He\n\nsearched the Scriptures in a new way, not for the discussion of a\n\ntheory, but in order to receive life for the soul. He began to see the\n\nkingdom of heaven as he submitted himself to the leading of the\n\nHoly Spirit....\n\nFor a time Nicodemus did not publicly acknowledge Christ, but\n\nhe watched His life, and pondered His teachings. In the Sanhedrin\n\ncouncil he repeatedly thwarted the schemes of the priests to destroy\n\nHim....\n\nAfter the Lord’s ascension, when the disciples were scattered by\n\npersecution, Nicodemus came boldly to the front.

Satan had interposed between\n\nPeter and his Master, that the heart of the disciple might not be\n\ntouched at the vision of Christ’s humiliation for him. The words of\n\nChrist were spoken, not to Peter, but to the one who was trying to\n\nseparate him from his Redeemer. “Get thee behind Me, Satan.” No\n\nlonger interpose between Me and My erring servant. Let Me come\n\nface to face with Peter, that I may reveal to him the mystery of My\n\nlove.\n\nIt was to Peter a bitter lesson, and one which he learned but\n\nslowly, that the path of Christ on earth lay through agony and hu-\n\nmiliation.

Both these disciples had the same opportunities\n\nto study and follow the divine Pattern. Both were closely associ-\n\nated with Jesus and were privileged to listen to His teaching. Each\n\npossessed serious defects of character; and each had access to the\n\ndivine grace that transforms character. But while one in humility\n\nwas learning of Jesus, the other revealed that he was not a doer of\n\nthe word, but a hearer only. One, daily dying to self and overcoming\n\nsin, was sanctified through the truth; the other, resisting the trans-\n\nforming power of grace and indulging selfish desires, was brought\n\ninto bondage to Satan.\n\nSuch transformation of character as is seen in the life of John\n\nis ever the result of communion with Christ.

Matthew, whose training had taught\n\nhim accuracy in all things, was very particular in regard to honesty,\n\nand he was ever contemplating the words of Christ, and became so\n\nabsorbed in them that, as Judas thought, he could not be trusted to\n\ndo sharp, farseeing business.

Luke 23:26.\n\nJesus had hardly passed the gate of Pilate’s house when the cross\n\nwhichhadbeen preparedforBarabbaswasbroughtoutandlaidupon\n\nHis bruised and bleeding shoulders. He had borne His burden but\n\na few rods, when, from loss of blood and excessive weariness and\n\npain, He fell fainting to the ground. When He revived, the cross was\n\nagain placed upon His shoulders, and He was forced forward. He\n\nstaggered on for a few steps, bearing His heavy load, and then fell as\n\none lifeless to the ground. The priests and rulers felt no compassion\n\nfor their suffering victim, but they saw that it was impossible for\n\nHim to carry the instrument of torture farther. They were puzzled\n\nto find anyone who would humiliate himself to bear the cross to the\n\nplace of execution.35\n\nThe crowd that followed the Saviour to Calvary taunted and\n\nreviled Him because He could not carry the wooden cross. They all\n\nsaw the weak and staggering steps of Christ, but compassion did not\n\nreveal itself in the hearts of those who had advanced from one step\n\nto another in their abuse and torture of the Son of God....\n\nA stranger, Simon, a Cyrenian, coming to the city from the\n\ncountry, hears the crowd pass the taunts and ribaldry; he hears the\n\ncontemptuous repetition, “Make way for the King of the Jews.” He\n\nstops in astonishment at the scene, and as he expresses his compas-\n\nsion in words and deeds, they seize him and compel him to lift the\n\ncross which is too heavy for Christ to bear.... That wooden cross\n\nborne by him to Calvary was the means of Simon taking upon him-\n\nself the cross of Christ from choice, to ever cheerfully stand beneath\n\nits burden. His compulsory companionship with Christ in bearing\n\n664\n\nCrossBearer,November 15 665\n\nHis cross to Calvary, in beholding the sad and dreadful work and\n\nthe spectators beneath the cross, was the means of drawing his heart\n\nto Jesus. Every word from the lips of Christ was graven upon his\n\nsoul.... And the heart of Simon believed.36"

It was the prayer of the penitent thief.... This man was not a\n\nhardened criminal; he had been led astray by evil associations.... He\n\nhad seen and heard Jesus, and had been convicted by His teaching,\n\nbut he had been turned away from Him by the priests and rulers.\n\nSeeking to stifle conviction, he had plunged deeper and deeper into\n\nsin, until he was arrested, tried as a criminal, and condemned to die\n\non the cross.\n\nIn the judgment hall and on the way to Calvary he had been in\n\ncompany with Jesus. He had heard Pilate declare, “I find no fault\n\nin Him” (John 19:4). He had marked His godlike bearing, and His\n\npitying forgiveness of His tormentors.... The conviction comes back\n\nto him that this is the Christ. Turning to his fellow criminal he says,\n\n“Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?”\n\nThe dying thieves have no longer anything to fear from man. But\n\nupon one of them presses the conviction that there is a God to fear,\n\na future to cause him to tremble. And now, all sin-polluted as it is,\n\nhis life history is about to close....\n\nWhen condemned for his crime, the thief had become hopeless\n\nand despairing; but strange, tender thoughts now spring up. He calls\n\nto mind all he has heard of Jesus.... The Holy Spirit illuminates his\n\nmind, and little by little the chain of evidence is joined together. In\n\nJesus, bruised, mocked, and hanging upon the cross, he sees the\n\nLamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world.

We cannot enjoy the favor of God\n\nunless we comply with the conditions upon which His favor is be-\n\nstowed. By so doing there will come to us that peace, contentment,\n\nand wisdom that the world can neither give nor take away.... A\n\nhumble mind and a grateful heart will elevate us above petty trials\n\nand real difficulties. The less earnest, energetic, and vigilant we are\n\nin the service of the Master, the more will the mind dwell upon self,\n\nmagnifying molehills into mountains of difficulty....\n\nThe burden of God’s work, laid upon Moses, made him a man\n\nof power. While keeping, for so many years, the flocks of Jethro, he\n\ngained an experience that taught him true humility.... The command\n\nto deliver Israel seemed overwhelming; but, in the fear of God,\n\nMoses accepted the trust. Mark the result: He did not bring the work\n\ndown to his deficiency; but in the strength of God he put forth the\n\nmost earnest efforts to elevate and sanctify himself for his sacred\n\nmission.\n\nMoses would never have been prepared for his position of trust\n\nhad he waited for God to do the work for him. Light from heaven\n\nwill come to those who feel the need of it, and who seek for it as\n\nfor hidden treasures. But if we sink down into a state of inactivity,\n\nwilling to be controlled by Satan’s power, God will not send His\n\ninspiration to us. Unless we exert to the utmost the powers which\n\nHe has given us, we shall ever remain weak and inefficient. Much\n\nprayer and the most vigorous exercise of the mind are necessary if\n\nwe would be prepared to do the work which God would entrust to us.\n\nMany never attain to the position which they might occupy, because\n\nthey wait for God to do for them that which He has given them\n\npower to do for themselves. All who are fitted for usefulness, in this\n\nlife must be trained by the severest mental and moral discipline, and\n\n756\n\nFirstThingsFirst,December 30 757\n\nthen God will assist them by combining divine power with human\n\neffort....\n\nWrong habits are not overcome by a single effort. Only through\n\nlong and severe struggle is self mastered.51"

In opposition to\n\nrighteousness, men become instruments of unrighteousness. But\n\nthey are not forced to take this course of action. They need not\n\nbecome instruments of unrighteousness, any more than Cain needed\n\nto....\n\nMen of all characters, righteous and unrighteous, will stand in\n\ntheir several positions in God’s plan. With the characters they have\n\nformed, they will act their part in the fulfillment of history. In a\n\ncrisis, just at the right moment, they will stand in the places they\n\nhave prepared themselves to fill. Believers and unbelievers will fall\n\ninto line as witnesses to confirm truth that they themselves do not\n\ncomprehend. All will cooperate in accomplishing the purposes of\n\nGod, just as did Annas, Caiaphas, Pilate, and Herod. In putting\n\nChrist to death, the priests thought they were carrying out their own\n\npurposes, but unconsciously and unintentionally they were fulfilling\n\nthe purpose of God.52\n\nGodlooksintothetinyseedthatHeHimselfhasformed,andsees\n\nwrapped within it the beautiful flower, the shrub, or the lofty, wide-\n\nspreadingtree.
