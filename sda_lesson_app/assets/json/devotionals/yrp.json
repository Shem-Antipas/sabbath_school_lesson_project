        "content": "When Christ gave His disciples the promise of the Spirit, He was\nnearing the close of His earthly ministry. He was standing in the\nshadow of the cross, with a full realization of the load of guilt that\nwas to rest upon Him as the Sin Bearer. Before offering Himself\nas the sacrificial victim, He instructed His disciples regarding a\nmost essential and complete gift which He was to bestow upon His\nfollowers—the gift that would bring within their reach the boundless\nresources of His grace.\n“I will pray the Father,” He said, “and he shall give you another\nComforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of\ntruth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not,\nneither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you,\nand shall be in you” (John 14:16, 17). The Saviour was pointing\nforward to the time when the Holy Spirit should come to do a mighty\nwork as His representative. The evil that had been accumulating for\ncenturies was to be resisted by the divine power of the Holy Spirit....\nThe promise of the Holy Spirit is not limited to any age or to\nany race. Christ declared that the divine influence of His Spirit was\nto be with His followers unto the end. From the day of Pentecost\nto the present time, the Comforter has been sent to all who have\nyielded themselves fully to the Lord and to His service. To all who\nhave accepted Christ as a personal Saviour, the Holy Spirit has come\nas a counselor, sanctifier, guide, and witness. The more closely\nbelievers have walked with God, the more clearly and powerfully\nhave they testified of their Redeemer’s love and of His saving grace.\nThe men and women who through long centuries of persecution and\ntrial enjoyed a large measure of the presence of the Spirit in their\nlives have stood as signs and wonders in the world. Before angels\nPromiseoftheSpirit,January1 19\nand men they have revealed the transforming power of redeeming\nlove.—The Acts of the Apostles, 47-49."

        "verse_ref": " John 16:13",
        "content": "How can we stand in the day of test if we do not understand the\nwords of Christ? He said: “These things have I spoken unto you,\nbeing yet present with you. But the Comforter, which is the Holy\nGhost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you\nall things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I\nhave said unto you” (John 14:25, 26). It is the Holy Spirit that is to\nbring to our remembrance the words of Christ. The theme Christ\nchose to dwell upon in His last discourse to His disciples was that of\nthe office of the Holy Spirit. He opened before them a wide tract of\ntruth. They were to receive His words by faith, and the Comforter,\nthe Holy Spirit, was to bring all things to their remembrance.\nThe consolation given by Christ in this promise was found in the\nfact that the divine influence was to be with His followers to the end.\nBut this promise is not accepted and believed by the people today,\nand therefore is not cherished by them, nor is its fulfillment seen in\nthe experience of the church. The promise of the gift of the Spirit\nof God is left as a matter to be little considered by the church. It\nis not impressed upon the people, and the result is only that which\nmight be expected—spiritual drought, spiritual darkness, spiritual\ndeclension and death. Minor matters occupy the mind and soul, but\ndivine power which is necessary for the growth and prosperity of\nthe church, which would, if possessed, bring all other blessings in\nits train, is lacking, although it is offered to us in infinite plentitude.\nJust as long as the church are satisfied with small things, they are\ndisqualified to receive the great things of God.

        "verse_ref": " John 14:17",
        "content": "It is not essential for us to be able to define just what the Holy\nSpirit is. Christ tells us that the Spirit is the Comforter, “the Spirit\nof truth, which proceedeth from the Father.” It is plainly declared\nregarding the Holy Spirit that, in His work of guiding men into all\ntruth, “He shall not speak of himself” (John 15:26; 16:13).\nThe nature of the Holy Spirit is a mystery. Men cannot explain\nit, because the Lord has not revealed it to them. Men having fanciful\nviews may bring together passages of Scripture and put a human\nconstruction on them, but the acceptance of these views will not\nstrengthen the church. Regarding such mysteries, which are too\ndeep for human understanding, silence is golden.\nThe office of the Holy Spirit is distinctly specified in the words\nof Christ: “When he is come, he will reprove the world of sin,\nand of righteousness, and of judgment” (John 16:8). It is the Holy\nSpirit that convicts of sin. If the sinner responds to the quickening\ninfluence of the Spirit, he will be brought to repentance and aroused\nto the importance of obeying the divine requirements.\nTotherepentantsinner,hungeringandthirstingforrighteousness,\nthe Holy Spirit reveals the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of\nthe world. “He shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you,”\nChrist said. “He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to\nyour remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you” (John 16:14;\n14:26).\nThe Spirit is given as a regenerating agency, to make effectual\nthe salvation wrought by the death of our Redeemer. The Spirit is\nconstantly seeking to draw the attention of men to the great offering\nthat was made on the cross of Calvary, to unfold to the world the\nNatureoftheSpirit: AMystery,January3 23\nlove of God, and to open to the convicted soul the precious things of\nthe Scriptures.—The Acts of the Apostles, 51, 52."

It is not the logical sermon, the sermon to convince the\nintellect, that will do this work. The heart must be persuaded, and\nmelted into tenderness.

There is no confusion, no\ndistrust, because by faith we see Jesus ordained of God for this very\npurpose, to make reconciliation for the sins of the world.

        "content": "The Comforter is called “the Spirit of truth.” His work is to\ndefine and maintain the truth.

Through the Scriptures the Holy Spirit\nspeaks to the mind, and impresses truth upon the heart. Thus He\nexposes error, and expels it from the soul. It is by the Spirit of truth,\nworking through the Word of God, that Christ subdues His chosen\npeople to Himself.\nIn describing to His disciples the office work of the Holy Spirit,\nJesus sought to inspire them with the joy and hope that inspired\nHis own heart. He rejoiced because of the abundant help He had\nprovided for His church. The Holy Spirit was the highest of all gifts\nthat He could solicit from His Father for the exaltation of His people.\nThe Spirit was to be given as a regenerating agent, and without this\nthe sacrifice of Christ would have been of no avail.

A person may not be able to tell the exact\ntime or place, or to trace all the circumstances in the process of\nconversion; but this does not prove him to be unconverted.\nBy an agency as unseen as the wind, Christis constantly working\nupon the heart. Little by little, perhaps unconsciously to the receiver,\nimpressions are made that tend to draw the soul to Christ. These\nmay be received through meditating upon Him, through reading the\nScriptures, or through hearing the Word from the living preacher.\nSuddenly,astheSpiritcomeswithmoredirectappeal,thesoulgladly\nsurrenders itself to Jesus.

So the work of the Spirit upon the soul\nwill reveal itself in every act of him who has felt its saving power.\nWhen the Spirit of God takes possession of the heart, it transforms\nthe life. Sinful thoughts are put away, evil deeds are renounced;\nlove, humility, and peace take the place of anger, envy, and strife.\nJoy takes the place of sadness, and the countenance reflects the light\nof heaven.

They are like the foolish virgins,\nwho had no oil in their vessels with their lamps. Oil is a symbol of\nthe Holy Spirit, which is brought into the soul through faith in Jesus\nChrist.

The\nteachings of the Word of God are not yea and nay, but yea and amen.\nThe requirement of the gospel is far-reaching.

The religion of the Bible must be\nbrought into the large and the little affairs of life. It must furnish the\npowerful motives and principles that will regulate the Christian’s\ncharacter and course of action....\nThe oil so much needed by those who are represented as foolish\nvirgins, is not something to be put on the outside.

Says the apostle Peter: “As every man hath\nreceived the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good\nstewards of the manifold grace of God” (1 Peter 4:10). Said Jesus\nto His disciples as He sent them forth, “Freely ye have received,\nfreely give” (Matthew 10:8). In him who is fully in sympathy with\nChrist, there can be nothing selfish or exclusive.

Christ Himself calls our attention to the growth\nof the vegetable world as an illustration of the agency of His Spirit\nin sustaining spiritual life. The sap of the vine, ascending from the\nroot, is diffused to the branches, sustaining growth and producing\nblossoms and fruit. So the life-giving power of the Holy Spirit,\nproceeding from the Saviour, pervades the soul, renews the motives\nand affections, and brings even the thoughts into obedience to the\nwill of God, enabling the receiver to bear the precious fruit of holy\ndeeds.\nThe Author of this spiritual life is unseen, and the exact method\nby which that life is imparted and sustained, it is beyond the power\nof human philosophy to explain.

When Christ came into the world, the\nleaders of the Jews were so permeated with Phariseeism that they\ncould not receive His teachings. Jesus compared them to the shriv-\neled wineskins which were not fit to receive the new wine from the\nvintage. He had to find new bottles into which to put the new wine\nof His kingdom. This was why He turned away from the Pharisees,\nand chose the lowly fishermen of Galilee.\nJesus was the greatest teacher the world ever knew, and He chose\nmen whom He could educate, and who would take the words from\nHis lips, and send them down along the line to our time. So, by His\nSpirit and His Word, He would educate you for His work. Just as\nsurely as you empty your mind of vanity and frivolity, the vacuum\nwill be supplied with that which God is waiting to give you—His\nHoly Spirit. Then out of the good treasure of the heart you will bring\nforth good things, rich gems of thought, and others will catch the\nwords, and will begin to glorify God. Then you will not have the\nmind centered upon self. You will not be making a show of self; you\nwill not be acting self; but your thoughts and affections will dwell\nupon Christ, and you will reflect upon others that which has shone\nupon you from the Sun of righteousness.\nChrist has said: “If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and\ndrink” (John 7:37). Have you exhausted the fountain?—No; for it is\ninexhaustible. Just as soon as you feel your need, you may drink,\nand drink again. The fountain is always full. And when you have\nonce drunk of that fountain, you will not be seeking to quench your\nthirst from the broken cisterns of this world; you willnot be studying\n42 YeShallReceivePower\nhow you can find the most pleasure, amusement, fun, and frolic.

By every hesitation\nand delay, we place ourselves where it is more and more difficult for\nus to accept the light of heaven, and at last it seems impossible to\nbe impressed by admonitions and warnings. The sinner says, more\nand more easily, “Go thy way for this time; when I have a more\nconvenient season, I will call for thee” (Acts 24:25).\nI know the danger of those who refuse to walk in the light as\nGod gives it. They bring upon themselves the terrible crisis of being\nleft to follow their own ways, to do after their own judgment. The\nconscience becomes less and less impressible. The voice of God\nseems to become more and more distant, and the wrongdoer is left\nto his own infatuation. In stubbornness he resists every appeal,\ndespises all counsel and advice, and turns from every provision\nmade for his salvation, and the voice of the messenger of God makes\nno impression upon his mind. The Spirit of God no longer exerts\na restraining power over him, and the sentence is passed, “[He]\nis joined to idols, let him alone” (Hosea 4:17). Oh, how dark,\n64 YeShallReceivePower\nhow sullen, how obstinate, is his independence! It seems that the\ninsensibility of death is upon his heart. This is the process through\nwhich the soul passes that rejects the working of the Holy Spirit.—"

If we will heed its lessons,\nwe shall become wise unto salvation. But we need to guard well\nour hearts; for too often we forget the heavenly instruction we have\nreceived, and seek to act out the natural inclinations of our unconse-\ncrated minds. Each one must fight his own battle against self. Heed\nthe teachings of the Holy Spirit.

And in God’s service there\nmust be no halfway work. Those who profess to serve God and yet\nindulge their natural impulses will mislead other souls.

Christ told them plainly\nthat in attributing the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan, they were\ncutting themselves off from the fountain of blessing. Those who had\nspoken against Jesus Himself, not discerning His divine character,\nmight receive forgiveness; for through the Holy Spirit they might be\nbrought to see their error and repent. Whatever the sin, if the soul\nrepents and believes, the guilt is washed away in the blood of Christ;\nbut he who rejects the work of the Holy Spirit is placing himself\nwhere repentance and faith cannot come to him.\nIt is by the Spirit that God works upon the heart; when men\nwillfully reject the Spirit, and declare Him to be from Satan, they cut\noff the channel by which God can communicate with them. When\nthe Spirit is finally rejected, there is no more that God can do for the\nsoul....\nIt is not God that blinds the eyes of men or hardens their hearts.\nHe sends them light to correct their errors, and to lead them in safe\npaths; it is by the rejection of this light that the eyes are blinded\nand the heart hardened. Often the process is gradual, and almost\nimperceptible. Light comes to the soul through God’s Word, through\nHis servants, or by the direct agency of His Spirit; but when one\nray of light is disregarded, there is a partial benumbing of the spir-\nitual perceptions, and the second revealing of light is less clearly\ndiscerned. So the darkness increases, until it is night in the soul.\nThus it had been with these Jewish leaders. They were convinced\nWillfullyRejectingtheSpirit,January28 71\nthat a divine power attended Christ, but in order to resist the truth,\nthey attributed the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan.

Romans 8:12, 13.\nThe promise of the Holy Spirit is not limited to any age or to any\nrace. Christ declared that the divine influence of His Spirit was to be\nwith His followers unto the end. From the day of Pentecost to the\npresent time, the Comforter has been sent to all who have yielded\nthemselves fully to the Lord and to His service. To all who have\naccepted Christ as a personal Saviour, the Holy Spirit has come as a\ncounselor, sanctifier, guide, and witness. The more closely believers\nhave walked with God, the more clearly and powerfully have they\ntestified of their Redeemer’s love and of His saving grace. The men\nand women who through the long centuries of persecution and trial\nenjoyed a large measure of the presence of the Spirit in their lives\nhave stood as signs and wonders in the world. Before angels and\nmen they have revealed the transforming power of redeeming love.\nThose who at Pentecost were endued with power from on high,\nwere not thereby freed from further temptation and trial. As they\nwitnessed for truth and righteousness they were repeatedly assailed\nby the enemy of all truth, who sought to rob them of their Christian\nexperience. They were compelled to strive with all their God-given\npowers to reach the measure of the stature of men and women in\nChrist Jesus. Daily they prayed for fresh supplies of grace, that they\nmight reach higher and still higher toward perfection. Under the\nHoly Spirit’s working even the weakest, by exercising faith in God,\nlearned to improve their entrusted powers and to become sanctified,\nrefined, and ennobled. As in humility they submitted to the molding\ninfluence of the Holy Spirit, they received of the fullness of the\nGodhead and were fashioned in the likeness of the divine.—The\nActs of the Apostles, 49, 50."

It is through the influence of the\nHoly Spirit that we are convinced of sin, and feel our need of pardon.\nNone but the contrite are forgiven; but it is the grace of the Lord that\nmakes the heart penitent. He is acquainted with all our weaknesses\nand infirmities, and He will help us. He will hear the prayer of faith;\nbut the sincerity of prayer can be proved only by our efforts to bring\nourselves into harmony with the great moral standard which will test\nevery man’s character.\nWe need to open our hearts to the influence of the Spirit, and\nto experience its transforming power.

        "content": "In our day the church has been to a great degree content with the\nsurface truths of revelation, made so plain and easy to be understood\nthat many have thought these supplied all that was essential, and in\naccepting them they have been content. But the Holy Spirit, working\nupon the mind, will not allow it to rest in indolence. It awakens an\nearnest desire for truth uncorrupted with error and false doctrines.\nCelestial truth will reward the diligent seeker. The mind that is really\ndesirous to know what is truth cannot be content in indolence.\nThe kingdom of heaven is likened to treasure hid in a field, “the\nwhich when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth\nand selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.” He buys it that\nhe may work it, plow up every part of it, and take possession of\nits treasures. It is the Holy Spirit’s office to direct this search and\nto reward it. The searcher, while digging the field, finds leads of\nprecious ore of which he seeks to estimate the value, and he sinks\nthe shaft deeper, for still more valuable treasure. Thus many a rich\nlode is discovered. The gold fields of the earth are not so interlaced\nwith veins of precious ore as is the field of revelation with leads that\nbring to view the unsearchable riches of Christ.\nThe Lord would have every one of His believing children rich\nin faith; and this is the fruit of the working of the Holy Spirit upon\nthe heart. From the heart the Spirit works outward, developing a\ncharacter that God will approve. What a vast field of the treasures of\ntruth did Christ add to the domain of faith to be appropriated by His\ndisciples! We need greater faith if we would have better knowledge\nof the Word. The greatest hindrance to our receiving the divine\nLookingforTreasures,April6 209\nillumination is that we do not depend on the efficiency of the Holy\nSpirit.—The Ellen G.

Before open-\ning its pages, we should ask for the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit,\nand it will be given. When Nathanael came to Jesus, the Saviour\nexclaimed, “Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile” (John\nMeditatingonGod’sWord,April16 229\n1:47). Nathanael said, “Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered\nand said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast\nunder the fig tree, I saw thee” (verse 48). And Jesus will see us also\nin the secret place of prayer, if we will seek Him for light, that we\nmay know what is truth. Angels from the world of light will be with\nthose who in humility of heart seek for divine guidance.—Atlantic"

He does not leave us to vague surmising as to what the\ntruth is, but adds, “Thy word is truth.” The Word of God is the\nmeans by which our sanctification is to be accomplished.

The more closely the believer walks with God,\nthe clearer his witness, and, as a sure result, the more powerful will\nbe the influence of his testimony upon others of a Saviour’s love;\nthe more he will give evidence that he prizes the Word of God. It\nis his meat, it is his drink, to satisfy the thirsty soul. He prizes the\nprivilege of learning the will of God from His Word.\nSome souls who claim to be believers have slighted, and turned\nfrom, the Word of God. They have neglected the Bible, the wonder-\nful Guidebook, the true tester of all ideas, and claim that they have\nthe Spirit to teach them, that this renders searching the Scriptures\nunnecessary. All such are heeding the sophistry of Satan, for the\nSpirit and the Word agree.

There will be human wisdom to\nmeet—the wisdom of learned men, who, as were the Pharisees, are\nteachers of the law of God, but do not obey the law themselves.\nThere will be human ignorance and folly to meet in disconnected\ntheories arrayed in new and fantastic dress—theories that it will be\nall the more difficult to meet because there is no reason in them.\nThere will be false dreams and false visions, which have some\ntruth, but lead away from the original faith. The Lord has given men\na rule by which to detect them: “To the law and to the testimony:\nif they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no\nlight in them” (Isaiah 8:20). If they belittle the law of God, if they\npay no heed to His will as revealed in the testimonies of His Spirit,\nthey are deceivers. They are controlled by impulse and impressions,\nwhich they believe to be from the Holy Spirit, and consider more\nreliable than the Inspired Word. They claim that every thought and\nfeeling is an impression of the Spirit; and when they are reasoned\nwith out of the Scriptures, they declare that they have something\nmore reliable. But while they think that they are led by the Spirit of\nGod, they are in reality following an imagination wrought upon by\nSatan.—Selected Messages 2:98, 99.\nSatan will work in a most subtle manner to introduce human\ninventions clothed with angel garments.

On the contrary, the Spirit was promised by our\nSaviour, to open the Word to His servants, to illuminate and apply\nits teachings. And since it was the Spirit of God that inspired the\nBible, it is impossible that the teaching of the Spirit should ever be\ncontrary to that of the Word.\nThe Spirit was not given—nor can it ever be bestowed—to su-\npersede the Bible; for the Scriptures explicitly state that the Word of\nGod is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be\ntested.

Eternal life is the receiving of the living elements in the\nScriptures and doing the will of God. This is eating the flesh and\ndrinking the blood of the Son of God. To those who do this, life\nand immortality are brought to light through the gospel, for God’s\nWord is verity and truth, spirit and life. It is the privilege of all who\nbelieve in Jesus Christ as their personal Saviour to feed on the Word\nof God. The Holy Spirit’s influence renders that Word, the Bible, an\nimmortal truth, which to the prayerful searcher gives spiritual sinew\nand muscle.\n“Search the scriptures,” Christ declared, “for in them ye think ye\nhave eternal life: and they are they which testify of me” (John 5:39).\nThose who dig beneaththe surface discoverthe hidden gems oftruth.\nThe Holy Spirit is present with the earnest searcher. His illumination\nshines upon the Word, stamping the truth upon the mind with a new,\nfresh importance. The searcher is filled with a sense of peace and\njoy never before felt. The preciousness of truth is realized as never\nbefore. A new, heavenly light shines upon the Word, illuminating\nit as though every letter were tinged with gold. God Himself has\nspoken to the mind and heart, making the Word spirit and life.\nEvery true searcher of the Word lifts his heart to God, imploring\nthe aid of the Spirit. And he soon discovers that which carries him\nabove all the fictitious statements of the would-be teacher, whose\nweak, tottering theories are not sustained by the Word of the living\nGod. These theories were invented by men who had not learned the\n252 YeShallReceivePower\nfirst great lesson, that God’s Spirit and life are in His Word. If they\nhad received in the heart the eternal element contained in the Word\nof God, they would see how tame and expressionless are all efforts\nto get something new to create a sensation. They need to learn the\nvery first principles of the Word of God.—Selected Messages 2:38,\n39."

They have received “the latter rain,” “the\nrefreshing from the presence of the Lord” (Acts 3:19), and they are\nprepared for the trying hour before them. Angels are hastening to\nand fro in heaven. An angel returning from the earth announces that\nhis work is done; the final test has been brought upon the world, and\nall who have proved themselves loyal to the divine precepts have\nreceived “the seal of the living God” (Revelation 7:2).\nThen Jesus ceases His intercession in the sanctuary above. He\nlifts His hands and with a loud voice says, “It is done,” and all the\nangelic host lay off their crowns as He makes the solemn announce-\nment: “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is\nfilthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be\nrighteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still” (Revelation\n22:11). Every case has been decided for life or death. Christ has\nmade the atonement for His people and blotted out their sins. The\nnumber of His subjects is made up; “the kingdom and dominion,\nand the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven” (Daniel\n7:27), is about to be given to the heirs of salvation, and Jesus is to\nreign as King of kings and Lord of lords.\nWhen He leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers the inhabitants\nof the earth. In that fearful time the righteous must live in the sight\nof a holy God without an intercessor. The restraint which has been\nupon the wicked is removed, and Satan has entire control of the\nfinally impenitent. God’s longsuffering has ended.

The greatest work on earth is to seek and to save those who are\nlost, for whom Christ has paid the infinite price of His own blood.\nEveryone is to do active service, and if those who have been blessed\nwith light do not diffuse light to others, they will lose the rich grace\nwhich has been bestowed upon them, because they neglect a sacred\nduty plainly marked out in the Word of God.

And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that\nSamuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord.”\nThe Israelites as a nation still continued in a state of irreligion\nand idolatry, and as a punishment they remained in subjection to the\nPhilistines. During this time Samuel visited the cities and villages\nthroughout the land, seeking to turn the hearts of the people to the\nGod of their fathers; and his efforts were not without good results.\nAfter suffering the oppression of their enemies for twenty years,\nthe Israelites “mourned after the Lord.” Samuel counseled them,\n“If ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away\nthe strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your\nhearts unto the Lord, and serve him only” (1 Samuel 7:3).\nHere we see that practical piety, heart religion, was taught in the\ndays of Samuel as taught by Christ when He was upon the earth.\nWithout the grace of Christ the outward forms of religion were\nvalueless to ancient Israel. They are the same to modern Israel.\nThere is need today of such a revival of true heart religion as\nwas experienced by ancient Israel.

Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel\nthou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone\nthereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it” (Zechariah 4:6,\n7).\nThroughout the history of God’s people, great mountains of\ndifficulty, apparently insurmountable, have loomed up before those\nwho were advancing in the opening providences of God.

Psalm 139:23, 24.\nAfter Christ’s ascension, the disciples were gathered together in\none place to make humble supplication to God. Andafterten days of\nheart searching and self-examination, the way was prepared for the\nHoly Spirit to enter the cleansed, consecrated soul temples. Every\nheart was filled with the Spirit, as though God desired to show His\npeople that it was His prerogative to bless them with the choicest of\nheaven’s blessings.\nWhat was the result?—Thousands were converted in a day. The\nsword of the Spirit flashed right and left. Newly edged with power,\nit pierced even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of\nthe joints and marrow. The idolatry that had been mingled with the\nworship of the people was overthrown. New territory was added\nto the kingdom of God. Places that had been barren and desolate\nsounded forth His praises. Believers, reconverted, born again, were\na living power for God. A new song was put in their mouths, even\npraise to the Most High.\nControlled by the Spirit, they saw Christ in their brethren. One\ninterest prevailed. One subject of emulation swallowed up all oth-\ners—to be like Christ, to do the works ofChrist. The earnestzealfelt\nwas expressed by loving helpfulness, by kindly words and unselfish\ndeeds. All strove to see who could do the most for the enlargement\nof Christ’s kingdom. “The multitude of them that believed were of\none heart and of one soul” (Acts 4:32).\nIn the twelve disciples the leaven of truth was hidden by the\nGreat Teacher. These disciples were to be the instruments in God’s\nhands for revealing truth to the world.

God will today endow men and women with power\nfrom above, as He endowed those who on the day of Pentecost heard\nthe word of salvation. At this very hour His Spirit and His grace are\nfor all who need them and will take Him at His word.\nNotice that it was after the disciples had come into perfect unity,\nwhen they were no longer striving for the highest place, that the\nSpirit was poured out. They were of one accord. All differences had\nbeen put away. And the testimony borne of them after the Spirit had\nbeen given is the same. Mark the word: “The multitude of them\nthat believed were of one heart and of one soul” (Acts 4:32). The\nSpirit of Him who died that sinners might live animated the entire\ncongregation of believers.\nThe disciples did not ask for a blessing for themselves. They\nwere weighted with the burden of souls. The gospel was to be\ncarried to the ends of the earth, and they claimed the endowment\nof power that Christ had promised. Then it was that the Holy Spirit\nwas poured out, and thousands were converted in a day.\nSo it may be now. Let Christians put away all dissension and\ngive themselves to God for the saving of the lost. Let them ask in\nfaith for the promised blessing, and it will come. The outpouring\nof the Spirit in the days of the apostles was “the former rain,” and\nglorious was the result.

The messengers of heaven are to be seen running\nto and fro, seeking in every possible way to warn the people of\nthe coming judgments, and presenting the glad tidings of salvation\nthrough our Lord Jesus Christ. The standard of righteousness is to\nbe exalted.\nThe Spirit of God is moving upon men’s hearts, and those who\nrespond to His influence will become lights in the world. Every-\nwhere they are seen going forth to communicate to others the light\nthey have received as they did after the descent of the Holy Spirit on\nthe day of Pentecost. And as they let their light shine, they receive\nmore and more of the Spirit’s power. The earth is lighted with the\nglory of God.\nBut, oh, sad picture! Those who do not submit to the influence\nof the Holy Spirit soon lose the blessings received when they ac-\nknowledged the truth as from heaven. They fall into a cold, spiritless\nformality; they lose their interest in perishing souls: they have “left\ntheir first love.” And Christ says unto them, “Remember therefore\nfrom whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or\nelse I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick\nout of his place, except thou repent” (Revelation 2:5). He will take\nHis Holy Spirit from the church, and give [the Spirit] to others who\nwill appreciate Him.\n590 YeShallReceivePower\nThere is no greater evidence that those who have received great\nlight do not appreciate that light, than is given by their refusal to\nlet their light shine upon those who are in darkness, and devoting\ntheir time and energies in celebrating forms and ceremonies.—The"

How many have lifted\nup their souls unto vanity! They think themselves exalted in the\nfavor of God, but they neglect the needy, they turn a deaf ear to the\ncalls of the oppressed, and speak sharp, cutting words to those who\nneed altogether different treatment.

Every act of obedience, every deed of self-denial, every trial\nbravely endured, every temptation resisted, every victory gained, is\na step forward in the march to eternal triumph.\nThere is hope forman. Christ says, “To him that overcometh will\nI grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am\nset down with my Father in his throne” (Revelation 3:21). But let us\nnever forget that the efforts we make in our own strength are utterly\nworthless. Our strength is weakness; our judgment foolishness.\nOnly in the name and strength of our Conqueror can we conquer.\nWhen we are pressed with temptation, when un-christlike desires\nclamor for the mastery, let us offer fervent, importunate prayer to\nthe heavenly Father, in the name of Christ. This will bring divine\naid. In the Redeemer’s name we may gain the victory.\nAs, seeing the sinfulness of sin, we fall helpless before the cross,\nasking forgiveness and strength, our prayer is heard and answered.\nThose who present their petitions to God in Christ’s name will never\nbe turned away. The Lord says, “Him that cometh to me I will in\nno wise cast out” (John 6:37). “He will regard the prayer of the\ndestitute” (Psalm 102:17). Our help comes from Him who holds all\nthings in His hands. The peace that He sends is the assurance of His\nlove to us.\nNothing can be more helpless and yet more invincible than the\nsoul that feel its nothingness, and relies wholly upon the merits of a\ncrucified and risen Saviour. God would send every angel in heaven\nto the aid of the one who places his whole dependence on Christ,\nrather than allow him to be overcome.\nIf we accept Christ as our Guide, He will lead us safely along\nthe narrow way. The road may be rough and thorny, and the ascent\n682 YeShallReceivePower\nsteep and dangerous; there may be pitfalls on the right hand and on\nthe left. When weary and longing for rest, we may have to toil on;\nwhen faint, we may have to fight; but with Christ as our guide, we\nshall not fail of reaching heaven.—The Signs of the Times, October\n29, 1902."

Those who worship God in sincerity and truth, and\nafflict their souls before Him as in the great day of atonement, will\nwash their robes of character and make them white in the blood of\nthe Lamb.

In this life we shall\nbe proved to see whether or not we shall be able to bear the test of\nGod. Satan’s temptations will come upon us, and we shall be tried,\nbut the question of most importance to us is Shall we be overcome?\nor shall we be overcomers? ... Like our great Example, we may be\nable to meet Satan with the weapon of God’s Word, saying to him\nas he tempts us to do evil, “It is written” (Matthew 4:4).\nSatan knows better than many professed Christians what is writ-\nten, for he is a diligent student of the Bible, and he works to pervert\nthe truth, and lead men into the paths of disobedience. He leads men\nto neglect the searching of the Word of God; for he knows that it\ntestifies against him, that his works are evil. It describes him as the\napostate angel who fell from heaven, and drew many of the hosts of\nheaven after him in a course of rebellion against their Creator.\nSatan is seeking continually to draw away the minds of men\nfrom God and His Word. He knows that if he can cause men to\nneglect the Word of God, he can soon cause them to depart from its\nprecepts, and finally to forget their Maker. They will then take the\nsuggestions and instructions of the adversary of God and man, and\nevil men and evil angels will form a confederacy against the God of\nheaven.\n704 YeShallReceivePower\nThose who would be loyal to God will be subject to trials and\ntemptations; but if they are truly alive unto God, and have their life\nhid with Christ in God, they will also know what it is to have the\nblessings which God bestows upon the faithful and obedient.—The"

We must come close to Jesus in loving obedience if we\nwould see the King in His beauty.\nThere is peace in believing, and joy in the Holy Ghost. Believe!\nBelieve! My soul cries, Believe! Rest in God.

Revelation\n1:7, 8.\nGod’s way is to make the day of small things the beginning of\nthe triumph of truth and righteousness.

His\npurposes for His chosen people are, like the eternal hills, firm and\nimmovable.\nRemember that human might did not establish the church of\nGod, neither can human might destroy it. From age to age the Holy\nSpirit is an overflowing fountain of life.... There is victory for all\nwho strive lawfully, in perfect harmony with the law of God. They\nwill triumph over all opposition.
