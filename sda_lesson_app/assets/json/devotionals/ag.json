As something strange and new, these words fall upon the ears\nof the wondering multitude. Such teaching is contrary to all they\nhave ever heard from priest or rabbi. They see in it nothing to flatter\ntheir pride or to feed their ambitious hopes. But there is about this\nnew Teacher a power that holds them spellbound. The sweetness of\ndivine love flows from His very presence as the fragrance from a\nflower....\nIn the throng that surrounded Jesus there were some who had\na sense of their spiritual poverty.... There were souls who, in the\npresence of His purity, felt that they were “wretched, and miserable,\nand poor, and blind, and naked” (Revelation 3:17); and they longed\nfor “the grace of God that bringeth salvation” (Titus 2:11)....\nOf the poor in spirit Jesus says, “Their’s is the kingdom of\nheaven.” This kingdom is not, as Christ’s hearers had hoped, a\ntemporal and earthly dominion. Christ was opening to them the\nspiritual kingdom of His love, His grace, His righteousness. ...\nHis subjects are the poor in spirit, the meek, the persecuted for\nrighteousness’ sake. The kingdom of heaven is theirs. Though not\nyet fully accomplished, the work is begun in them which will make\nthem “meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light”\n(Colossians 1:12).\nAll who have a sense of their deep soul poverty, who feel that\nthey have nothing good in themselves, may find righteousness and\nstrengthbylookinguntoJesus....

We should never have learned the meaning of\nthis word “grace” had we not fallen. God loves the sinless angels,\nwho do His service, and are obedient to all His commands; but He\ndoes not give them grace. These heavenly beings know naught of\ngrace; they have never needed it; for they have never sinned. Grace\nis an attribute of God shown to undeserving human beings. We did\nnot seek after it, but it was sent in search of us. God rejoices to\nbestow this grace upon every one who hungers for it. To every one\nHe presents terms of mercy, not because we are worthy, but because\nwe are so utterly unworthy. Our need is the qualification which gives\nus the assurance that we shall receive this gift.\nBut God does not use His grace to make His law of none effect,\nor to take the place of His law.... God’s grace and the law of His\nkingdom are in perfect harmony; they walk hand in hand. His grace\nmakes it possible for us to draw nigh to Him by faith. By receiving\nit, andletting itworkin ourlives, we testify to the validity ofthe law;\nwe exalt the law and make it honorable by carrying out its living\nprinciples through the power of the grace of Christ; and by rendering\npure, whole-hearted obedience to God’s law, we witness before the\nuniverse of heaven, and before an apostate world that is making void\nthe law of God, to the power of redemption.\nNot because we first loved Him, does God love us; but “while we\nwere yet sinners” (Romans 5:8) Christ died for us, making full and\nabundant provision for our redemption. Although by our disobedi-\nence we have merited God’s displeasure and condemnation, He has\nnot forsaken us; He has not left us to grapple with the power of the\nenemy in our own finite strength.

Galatians 4:4, 5.\nIn heaven’s council the hour for the coming of Christ had been\ndetermined. When the great clock of time pointed to that hour, Jesus\nwas born in Bethlehem.... Providence had directed the movements\nof nations, and the tide of human impulse and influence, until the\nworld was ripe for the coming of the Deliverer....\nThe deception of sin had reached its height. All the agencies for\ndepraving the souls of men had been put in operation. The Son of\nGod, looking upon the world, beheld suffering and misery. With pity\nHe saw how men had become victims of satanic cruelty. He looked\nwith compassion upon those who were being corrupted, murdered,\nand lost.... It was demonstrated before the universe that, apart from\nGod, humanity could not be uplifted. A new element of life and\npower must be imparted by Him who made the world.\nWith intense interest the unfallen worlds had watched to see\nJehovah arise, and sweep away the inhabitants of the earth.... But\ninstead of destroying the world, God sent His Son to save it.... At\nthe very crisis, when Satan seemed about to triumph, the Son of\nGod came with the embassage of divine grace. Through every age,\nthrough every hour, the love of God had been exercised toward the\nfallen race. Notwithstanding the perversity of men, the signals of\nmercy had been continually exhibited. And when the fullness of the\ntime had come, the Deity was glorified by pouring upon the world a\nflood of healing grace that was never to be obstructed or withdrawn\ntill the plan of salvation should be fulfilled.\nSatan was exulting that he had succeeded in debasing the image\nof God in humanity. Then Jesus came to restore in man the image of\nhis Maker. None but Christ can fashion anew the character that has\nbeen ruined by sin. He came to expel the demons that had controlled\nAtGod’sAppointedTime,January3 21\nthe will. He came to lift us up from the dust, to reshape the marred\ncharacter after the pattern of His divine character, and to make it\nbeautiful with His own glory."

Mark 1:14, 15.\nAs Jesus traveled through Galilee, teaching and healing, multi-\ntudes flocked to Him from the cities and villages. Many came even\nfrom Judea and the adjoining provinces. Often He was obliged to\nhide Himselffrom the people. The enthusiasm ran so highthatitwas\nnecessary to take precautions lest the Roman authorities should be\naroused to fear an insurrection. Never before had there been such a\nperiod as this for the world. Heaven was brought down to men. Hun-\ngering and thirsting souls that had waited long for the redemption of\nIsrael now feasted upon the grace of a merciful Saviour....\nThe gospel message, as given by the Saviour Himself, was based\non the prophecies. The “time” which He declared to be fulfilled was\nthe period made known by the angel Gabriel to Daniel.... “Know\ntherefore and understand, that from the going forth of the com-\nmandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the\nPrince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks” (Daniel\n9:25), sixty-nine weeks, or four hundred and eighty-three years. The\ncommandment to restore and build Jerusalem, as completed by the\ndecree of Artaxerxes Longimanus (see Ezra 6:14; 7:1, 9, margin),\nwent into effect in the autumn of 457 B.C. From this time four\nhundred and eighty-three years extend to the autumn of A.D. 27.\nAccording to the prophecy, this period was to reach to the Messiah,\nthe Anointed One. In A.D. 27, Jesus at His baptism received the\nanointing of the Holy Spirit, and soon afterward began His ministry.\nThen the message was proclaimed, “The time is fulfilled”....\nThe time of Christ’s coming, His anointing by the Holy Spirit,\nHisdeath,andthegivingofthegospeltotheGentiles,weredefinitely\npointed out.... “The Spirit of Christ which was in them” “testified\nbeforehand the sufferings ofChrist, and the glory that should follow”\nMessageoftheFirstAdvent,January4 23\n(1 Peter 1:11)....

His\npurpose was to establish a kingdom which would be governed by\nhis own laws, and carried on with his own resources, independent\nof God; and so well did he succeed, that when Christ came to the\nworld to establish a kingdom, He looked upon the governments of\nmen, and said, “Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God?”\nNothing in civil society afforded Him a comparison....\nIn striking contrast to the wrong and oppression so universally\npractised were the mission and work of Christ.... He planned a\ngovernment which would use no force; His subjects would know\nno oppression.... Not as a fierce tyrant did He come, but as the\nSon of man; not to conquer the nations by His iron power, but “to\npreach good tidings unto the meek;” “to bind up the brokenhearted,\nto proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison\nto them that are bound;” “to comfort all that mourn” (Isaiah 61:1,\n2). He came as the divine Restorer, bringing to oppressed and\ndowntrodden humanity the rich and abundant grace of Heaven, that\nby the power of His righteousness, man, fallen and degraded though\nhe was, might be a partaker of divinity....\nChrist taught that His church is a spiritual kingdom.

        "content": "To Daniel was given a vision of fierce beasts, representing the\npowers of the earth. But the ensign of the Messiah’s kingdom is a\nlamb. While earthly kingdoms rule by the ascendancy of physical\npower, Christ is to banish every carnal weapon, every instrument of\ncoercion. His kingdom was to be established to uplift and ennoble\nfallen humanity.\nTo Adam, the offering of the first sacrifice was a most painful\nceremony. His hand must be raised to take life, which only God\ncould give.... As he slew the innocent victim, he trembled at the\nthought that his sin must shed the blood of the spotless Lamb of God.\nThis scene gave him a deeper and more vivid sense of the greatness\nof his transgression, which nothing but the death of God’s dear Son\ncould expiate. And he marveled at the infinite goodness that would\ngive such a ransom to save the guilty.\nThe types and shadows of the sacrificial service, with the prophe-\ncies, gave the Israelites a veiled, indistinct view of the mercy and\ngrace to be brought to the world by the revelation of Christ.... Only\nthrough Christ can man keep the moral law. By transgression of this\nlaw man brought sin into the world, and with sin came death. Christ\nbecame the propitiation forman’s sin. He profferedHis perfection of\ncharacter in the place of man’s sinfulness. He took upon Himself the\ncurse of disobedience. The sacrifices and offerings pointed forward\nto the sacrifice He was to make. The slain lamb typified the Lamb\nthat was to take away the sin of the world....\nThe law and the gospel are in perfect harmony. Each upholds the\nother. In all its majesty the law confronts the conscience, causing\nthe sinner to feel his need of Christ as the propitiation for sin. The\ngospel recognizes the power and immutability of the law. “I had not\nknown sin, but by the law” (Romans 7:7), Paul declares. The sense\nEnsignofChrist’sKingdom,January7 29\nof sin, urged home by the law, drives the sinner to the Saviour. In\nhis need man may present the mighty arguments furnished by the\ncross of Calvary.

Yet the Saviour attempted no civil reforms.\nHe attacked no national abuses, nor condemned the national ene-\nmies. He did not interfere with the authority or administration of\nthose in power. He who was our example kept aloof from earthly\ngovernments. Not because He was indifferent to the woes of men,\nbut because the remedy did not lie in merely human and external\nmeasures. To be efficient, the cure must reach men individually, and\nmust regenerate the heart.\nSome of the Pharisees had come to Jesus demanding “when\nthe kingdom of God should come” (Luke 17:20). More than three\nyears had passed since John the Baptist gave the message that like\na trumpet call had sounded through the land, “The kingdom of\nheaven is at hand” (Matthew 3:2). And as yet these Pharisees saw\nno indication of the establishment of the kingdom....\nJesus answered, “The kingdom of God cometh not with outward\nshow [margin]: neither shall they say, Lo here! or lo there! for,\nbehold, the kingdom of God is within you.” The kingdom of God\nbegins at the heart. Look not here or there for manifestations of\nearthly power to mark its coming.\nThe works of Christ not only declared Him to be the Messiah,\nbut showed in what manner His kingdom was to be established....

Its development depends upon no human\npower. So it is with the kingdom of Christ. It is a new creation.\nIts principles of development are the opposite to those that rule the\nkingdoms of this world. Earthly governments prevail by physical\nforce; they maintain their dominion by war; but the founder of the\nnew kingdom is the Prince of Peace....

Compared with earthly kingdoms it appeared to be the\nleast of all. By the rulers of this world Christ’s claim to be a king\nwas ridiculed. Yet in the mighty truths committed to His followers\nthe kingdom of the gospel possessed a divine life. And how rapid\nwas its growth, how widespread its influence!

In order to see\nhis guilt, the sinner must test his character by God’s great standard\nof righteousness. It is a mirror which shows the perfection of a\nrighteous character and enables him to discern the defects of his\nown. The law reveals to man his sin....

Only He who knew the height and depth of the love of\nGod could make it known....\nThe plan for our redemption was not an afterthought, a plan\nformulated after the fall of Adam. It was a revelation of “the mystery\nwhich hath been kept in silence through times eternal” (Romans\n16:25, R.V.). It was an unfolding of the principles that from eternal\nages have been the foundation of God’s throne.... God did not\nordain that sin should exist, but He foresaw its existence, and made\nprovision to meet the terrible emergency. So great was His love for\nthe world, that He covenanted to give His only-begotten Son, “that\nwhosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting\nlife.”\nAs soon as there was sin, there was a Saviour. Christ knew that\nHe would have to suffer, yet He became man’s substitute. As soon\nas Adam sinned, the Son of God presented Himself as surety for the\nhuman race, with just as much power to avert the doom pronounced\nupon the guilty as when He died upon the cross of Calvary.\nWhat love! What amazing condescension! The King of glory\nproposes to humble Himself to fallen humanity! He would place\nByGod’sGrace,January15 45\nHis feet in Adam’s steps. He would take man’s fallen nature, and\nengage to cope with the strong foe who triumphed over Adam. He\nwould overcome Satan, and in thus doing He would open the way\nfor the redemption from the disgrace of Adam’s failure and fall, of\nall those who would believe on Him."

        "content": "Satan watches his opportunity to seize the precious graces when\nwe are unguarded, and we shall have a severe conflict with the\npowers of darkness to retain them, or to regain a heavenly grace if\nthrough lack of watchfulness we lose it. But ... it is the privilege of\nChristians to obtain strength from God to hold every precious gift.\nFervent and effectual prayer will be regarded in heaven. When the\nservants of Christ take the shield of faith for their defense, and the\nsword of the Spirit for war, there is danger in the enemy’s camp.\nAmidst the snares to which all are exposed, they need strong and\ntrustworthy defenses on which to rely. Many in this corrupt age have\nso small a supply of the grace of God, that in many instances their\ndefense is broken down by the first assault, and fierce temptations\ntake them captives. The shield of grace can preserve all unconquered\nby the temptations of the enemy, though surrounded with the most\ncorrupting influences. By firm principle, and unwavering trust in\nGod, their virtue and nobleness of character can shine, and, although\nsurrounded with evil, no taint need be left upon their virtue and\nintegrity.\nThe work of conquering evil is to be done through faith. Those\nwho go into the battlefield will find that they must put on the whole\narmor of God. The shield of faith will be their defense and will\nenable them to be more than conquerors. Nothing else will avail\nbut this—faith in the Lord of hosts, and obedience to His orders.\nVast armies furnished with every other facility will avail nothing in\nthe last great conflict. Without faith, an angel host could not help.\nLiving faith alone will make them invincible and enable them to\nstand in the evil day, steadfast, unmovable, holding the beginning of\ntheir confidence firm unto the end."

To this sin-darkened earth He came to\nreveal the light of God’s love—to be “God with us.”...\nOur little world is the lesson book of the universe. God’s won-\nderful purpose of grace, the mystery of redeeming love, is the theme\ninto which “angels desire to look”, and it will be their study through-\nout endless ages. Both the redeemed and the unfallen beings will\nfind in the cross of Christ their science and their song. It will be seen\nthat the glory shining in the face of Jesus is the glory of self-sac-\nrificing love. In the light from Calvary it will be seen that the law\nof self-renouncing love is the law of life for earth and heaven; that\nthe love which “seeketh not her own” has its source in the heart of\nGod....\nJesus might have remained at the Father’s side. He might have\nretained the glory of heaven, and the homage of the angels. But He\nchose to give back the scepter into the Father’s hands, and to step\ndown from the throne of the universe, that He might bring light to\nthe benighted, and life to the perishing....\nThis great purpose had been shadowed forth in types and sym-\nbols. The burning bush, in which Christ appeared to Moses, revealed\nGod.... The all-merciful God shrouded His glory in a most humble\ntype, that Moses could look upon it and live. So in the pillar of cloud\nby day and the pillar of fire by night, God communicated with Israel,\nrevealing to men His will, and imparting to them His grace. God’s\nglory was subdued, and His majesty veiled, that the weak vision of\nfinite men might behold it. So Christ was to come in “the body of\nour humiliation” (Philippians 3:21, R.V.), “in the likeness of men.”...\nGodwithUs,February6 89\nHis glory was veiled, His greatness and majesty were hidden, that\nHe might draw near to sorrowful, tempted men."

It testifies to the universe that\nGod will never forsake His people in their struggle with evil. It is an\nassurance to us of strength and protection as long as the throne itself\nshall endure.\nAs the bow in the cloud is formed by the union of the sunlight\nand the shower, so the rainbow encircling the throne represents the\ncombined power of mercy and justice. It is not justice alone that is\nto be maintained; for this would eclipse the glory of the rainbow of\npromise above the throne; man could see only the penalty of the law.\nWere there no justice, no penalty, there would be no stability to the\ngovernment of God.\nIt is the mingling of judgment and mercy that makes salvation\nfull and complete.

God is greatly to be reverenced; all who truly realize\nHis presence will bow in humility before Him.\nSome think it a mark of humility to pray to God in a common\nmanner, as if talking with a human being.

If everthere was a need of soul-stirring\nprayers and sermons, it is now. The end of all things is at hand. O\nthat we could see as we should the necessity of seeking the Lord\nwith all the heart!

He estimates every weight before He allows it to rest upon\nthe hearts of those who are laborers together with Him. To every one\nof His workers our loving heavenly Father says: “Cast thy burden\nToSustaintheBurdenBearer,April18 235\nupon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee” (Psalm 55:22).

The life that I now live, I am to “live by the faith of\nthe Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me” (Galatians\n2:20).\nThe apostle Paul clearly presents the relation between faith and\nthe law under the new covenant. He says: “Being justified by faith,\nwe have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.” “Do we\nthen make void the law through faith? God forbid; yea, we establish\nthe law.” “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through\nthe flesh”—it could not justify man, because in his sinful nature he\ncould not keep the law—“God sending his own Son in the likeness\nof sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh; that the\nAcceptedbyFaith,May12 285\nrighteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after\nthe flesh, but after the Spirit” (Romans 5:1; 3:31; 8:3, 4)."

The one was to close forever; the other, which He had just\nestablished, was to take its place, and to continue through all time\nas the memorial of His death....\nIn this last act of Christ in partaking with His disciples of the\nbread and wine, He pledged Himself to them as their Redeemer by a\nnew covenant, in which it was written and sealed that upon all who\nwill receive Christ by faith will be bestowed all the blessings that\nheaven can supply, both in this life and in the future immortal life.\nThis covenantdeedwas to be ratifiedby Christ’s own blood, whichit\nhad been the office of the old sacrificial offerings to keep before the\nminds of His chosen people. Christ designed that this supper should\nbe often commemorated in order to bring to our remembrance His\nsacrifice in giving His life for the remission of the sins of all who\nwill believe on Him and receive Him.\nIn the Saviour’s death the powers of darkness seemed to prevail,\nand they exulted in their victory. But from the rent sepulcher of\nJoseph, Jesus came forth a conqueror.\nJesus refused to receive the homage of His people until He had\nthe assurance that His sacrifice was accepted by the Father. He\nascended to the Heavenly courts, and from God Himself heard the\nassurance that His atonement for the sins of men had been ample,\nthat through His blood all might gain eternal life. The Father ratified\nthe covenant made with Christ, that He would receive repentant and\nobedientmen, andwouldlove them even as He loves His Son. Christ\nwas to complete His work, and fulfill His pledge to “make a man\nRatifiedbyChrist’sBlood,May24 309\nmore precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of\nOphir” (Isaiah 13:12)."

Here is love without a parallel....\nIt was not the gnawing pangs of hunger alone which made the\nsufferings of our Redeemer so inexpressibly severe. It was the sense\nof guilt which had resulted from the indulgence of appetite that had\nbrought such terrible woe into the world, which pressed so heavily\nupon His divine soul....\nWith man’s nature, and the terrible weight of his sins pressing\nupon Him, our Redeemer withstood the power of Satan upon this\ngreat leading temptation, which imperils the souls of men. If man\nshould overcome this temptation, he could conquer on every other\npoint.\nIntemperance lies at the foundation of all the moral evils known\nto man. Christ began the work of redemption just where the ruin\nbegan. The fall of our first parents was caused by the indulgence\nUnequaledTest,June5 335\nof appetite. In redemption, the denial of appetite is the first work\nof Christ. What amazing love has Christ manifested in coming into\nthe world to bear our sins and infirmities, and to tread the path of\nsuffering, that He might show us by His life of spotless merit how\nwe should walk, and overcome as He had overcome."

While in the world, He was not of the world. It was\na continual pain to Him to be brought in contact with the enmity,\ndepravity, and impurity which Satan had brought in; but He had a\nwork to do to bring man into harmony with the divine plan, and earth\nin connection with heaven, and He counted no sacrifice too great\nfor the accomplishment of the object. He “was in all points tempted\nlike as we are” (Hebrews 4:15).

As soon as this ceremony was completed, the Holy Spirit\ndescended upon the disciples in rich currents, and Christ was indeed\nglorified, even with the glory which He had with the Father from all\neternity. The Pentecostal outpouring was Heaven’s communication\nthat the Redeemer’s inauguration was accomplished.

When unconsciously we are in danger of exerting\na wrong influence, the angels will be by our side, prompting us to a\nbettercourse, choosing ourwords forus, and influencing ouractions.\nThus our influence may be a silent, unconscious, but mighty power\nin drawing others to Christ and the heavenly world.\nPersonal influence is a power. It is to work with the influence of\nChrist, to lift where Christ lifts, to impart correct principles, and to\nstay the progress of the world’s corruption. It is to diffuse that grace\nSourceofRightInfluence,September21 555\nwhich Christ alone can impart. It is to uplift, to sweeten the lives\nand characters of others by the power of a pure example united with\nearnest faith and love."

We must, each for himself, choose Christ, because\nHe has first chosen us. This union with Christ is to be formed by\nthose who are naturally at enmity with Him. It is a relation of utter\ndependence, to be entered into by a proud heart.

While Moses was in the\nmount, earnestly interceding with God, he prayed, “I beseech thee,\nshow me thy glory.” In answer God declared, “I will make all my\ngoodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord\nbefore thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and\nwill show mercy on whom I will show mercy.” The glory of God—\nHis character—was then revealed: “The Lord passed by before him,\nand proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious,\nlongsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy\nfor thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that\nwill by no means clear the guilty” (Exodus 33:18, 19; 34:6, 7).\nThis character was revealed in the life of Christ. That He might\nby His own example condemn sin in the flesh, He took upon Himself\nthe likeness of sinful flesh. Constantly he beheld the character of\nGod; constantly He revealed this character to the world.\nChrist desires His followers to reveal in their lives this same\ncharacter. In His intercessory prayer for His disciples He declared:\n“The glory [character] which thou gavest me I have given them; that\nthey may be one, even as we are one; I in them, and thou in me, that\nthey may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that\nthou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me” (John\n17:22, 23).\nToday it is still His purpose to sanctify and cleanse His church\n“... that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having\nspot, or wrinkle, or any such thing” ... (Ephesians 5:26, 27). No\ngreater gift than the character that He revealed, can Christ ask His\nFather to bestow upon those who believe on Him. What largeness\nthere is in His request!

If we will consent to lay down our arms, to lower\nthe blood-stained banner, to become the captives and servants of\nSatan, we may be released from the conflict and the suffering. But\nthis peace will be gained only at the loss of Christ and heaven. We\ncannot accept peace on such conditions. Let it be war, war, to the\nend of earth’s history, rather than peace through apostasy and sin.\nThe work of apostasy begins in some secret rebellion of the heart\nagainst the requirements of God’s law.

If we do not overcome these evils they\nwill overcome us....\nThe indulgence of spiritual pride, of unholy desires, of evil\nthoughts, of anything that separates us from an intimate and sacred\nassociation with Jesus, imperils oursouls....

The pure\ncommunion with holy beings, the harmonious social life with the\nblessedangelsandwiththefaithfulonesofallageswhohavewashed\ntheirrobes andmade them white in the bloodofthe Lamb, the sacred\nties thatbindtogether“the whole familyin heaven andearth”—these\nhelp to constitute the happiness of the redeemed.\nThere, immortal minds will contemplate with never-failing de-\nlight the wonders of creative power, the mysteries of redeeming love.\nThere will be no cruel, deceiving foe to tempt to forgetfulness of\nGod....\nAll the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of\nGod’s redeemed. Unfettered by mortality, they wing their tireless\nflighttoworldsafar—worldsthatthrilledwithsorrowatthespectacle\nof human woe and rang with songs of gladness at the tidings of a\nransomed soul.... With undimmed vision they gaze upon the glory\nof creation—suns and stars and systems, all in their appointed order\ncircling the throne of Deity. Upon all things, from the least to the\ngreatest, the Creator’s name is written, and in all are the riches of\nHis power displayed.\nAnd the years of eternity, as they roll, will bring richer and still\nmore glorious revelations of God and of Christ. As knowledge is\nprogressive, so will love, reverence, and happiness increase. The\nmore men learn of God, the greater will be their admiration of His\nExploringtheUniverse,December26 751\ncharacter. As Jesus opens before them the riches of redemption and\nthe amazing achievements in the great controversy with Satan, the\nhearts of the ransomed thrill with more fervent devotion, and with\nmore rapturous joy they sweep the harps of gold; and ten thousand\ntimes ten thousand and thousands of thousands of voices unite to\nswell the mighty chorus of praise."
