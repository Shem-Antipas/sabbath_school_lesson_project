    "content": "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his\nSon,...to redeem them that were under the law, that we might\nreceive the adoption of sons. Galatians 4:4, 5.\nThe Saviour’s coming was foretold in Eden. When Adam and\nEve first heard the promise, they looked for its speedy fulfillment.\nThey joyfully welcomed their first-born son, hoping that he might be\nthe Deliverer. But the fulfillment of the promise tarried. Those who\nfirst received it died without the sight. From the days of Enoch the\npromise was repeated through patriarchs and prophets, keeping alive\nthe hope of His appearing, and yet He came not. The prophecy of\nDaniel revealed the time of His advent, but not all rightly interpreted\nthe message. Century after century passed away; the voices of the\nprophets ceased. The hand of the oppressor was heavy upon Israel,\nand many were ready to exclaim, “The days are prolonged, and\nevery vision faileth.” Ezekiel 12:22.\nBut like the stars in the vast circuit of their appointed path, God’s\npurposes know no haste and no delay. Through the symbols of\nthe great darkness and the smoking furnace, God had revealed to\nAbraham the bondage of Israel in Egypt, and had declared that the\ntime of their sojourning should be four hundred years. “Afterward,”\nHe said, “shall they come out with great substance.” Genesis 15:14.\nAgainst that word, all the power of Pharaoh’s proud empire battled\nin vain. On “the self-same day” appointed in the divine promise, “it\ncame to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land\nof Egypt.” Exodus 12:41. So in heaven’s council the hour for the\ncoming of Christ had been determined. When the great clock of\ntime pointed to that hour, Jesus was born in Bethlehem.\n“When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his\nSon.” Providence had directed the movements of nations, and the\ntide of human impulse and influence, until the world was ripe for\nthe coming of the Deliverer....\n18\nFirstComingofJesus,January1 19\nThen Jesus came to restore in man the image of his Maker. None\nbut Christ can fashion anew the character that has been ruined by sin.\nHe came to expel the demons that had controlled the will. He came\nto lift us up from the dust, to reshape the marred character after the\npattern of His divine character, and to make it beautiful with His\nown glory."

Hebrews 9:28.\nAt the time of Christ’s first advent the priests and scribes of\nthe Holy City, to whom were entrusted the oracles of God, might\nhave discerned the signs of the times and proclaimed the coming\nof the Promised One.

Revelation 22:20.\nThe [second] coming of the Lord has been in all ages the hope of\nHis true followers. The Saviour’s parting promise upon Olivet, that\nHe would come again, lighted up the future for His disciples, filling\ntheir hearts with joy and hope that sorrow could not quench nor trials\ndim. Amid suffering and persecution, “the appearing of the great\nGod and our Saviour Jesus Christ” was the “blessed hope.” When\nthe Thessalonian Christians were filled with grief as they buried\ntheir loved ones, who had hoped to live to witness the coming of the\nLord, Paul, their teacher, pointed them to the resurrection, to take\nplace at the Saviour’s advent. Then the dead in Christ should rise,\nand together with the living be caught up to meet the Lord in the\nair. “And so,” he said, “shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore\ncomfort one another with these words.” 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18. ...\nFrom the dungeon, the stake, the scaffold, where saints and mar-\ntyrs witnessed for the truth, comes down the centuries the utterance\nof their faith and hope. Being “assured of His personal resurrection,\nand consequently of their own at His coming, for this cause,” says\none of these Christians, “they despised death, and were found to\nbe above it.”—Daniel T. Taylor, The Reign of Christ on Earth: or,\nThe Voice of the Church in All Ages, p. 33. They were willing\nto go down to the grave, that they might “rise free.” They looked\nfor the “Lord to come from heaven in the clouds with the glory of\nHis Father,” “bringing to the just the times of the kingdom.” The\nWaldenses cherished the same faith. Wycliffe looked forward to the\nRedeemer’s appearing as the hope of the church.\nOn rocky Patmos the beloved disciple hears the promise, “Surely\nI come quickly,” and his longing response voices the prayer of the\nchurch in all her pilgrimage, “Even so, come, Lord Jesus.” Revela-\ntion 22:20.\n24"

Job 19:25.\nOne of the most solemn and yet most glorious truths revealed in\nthe Bible is that of Christ’s second coming, to complete the great\nwork of redemption. To God’s pilgrim people, so long left to sojourn\nin “the region and shadow of death,” a precious, joy-inspiring hope\nis given in the promise of His appearing, who is “the resurrection\nand the life,” to “bring home again His banished.” The doctrine\nof the second advent is the very key-note of the Sacred Scriptures.\nFrom the day when the first pair turned their sorrowing steps from\nEden, the children of faith have waited the coming of the Promised\nOne to break the destroyer’s power and bring them again to the lost\nParadise. ... Enoch, only the seventh in descent from them that\ndwelt in Eden, he who for three centuries on earth walked with his\nGod, was permitted to behold from afar the coming of the Deliverer.\n“Behold,” he declared, “the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his\nsaints, to execute judgment upon all.” The patriarch Job in the night\nof his affliction exclaimed with unshaken trust: “I know that my\nredeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the\nearth:... in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself,\nand mine eyes shall behold, and not another.”\nMay the God of all grace so enlighten your understanding that\nyou may discern eternal things, that by the light of truth your own\nerrors, which are many, may be discovered to you just as they are,\nthat you may make the necessary effort to put them away, and in the\nplace of this evil, bitter fruit may bring forth fruit which is precious\nunto eternal life.\nHumble your poor, proud, self-righteous heart before God; get\nlow, very low, all broken in your sinfulness at His feet.

Thus it was with the\ndisciples of Christ, even when the Saviour was with them in person.\nTheir minds had become imbued with the popular conception of the\nMessiah as a temporal prince, who was to exalt Israel to the throne\nof the universal empire, and they could not understand the meaning\nof His words foretelling His sufferings and death....\nFrom their very birth their hearts had been set upon the antici-\npated glory of an earthly empire, and this blinded their understand-\ning....\nThe experience of the disciples who preached the “gospel of\nthe kingdom” at the first advent of Christ, had its counterpart in\nthe experience of those who proclaimed the message of His second\nadvent....\nLike the first disciples, William Miller and his associates did not,\nthemselves, fully comprehend the import of the message which they\nbore.

Holy\nangels have been employed in directing this work, they have in\ncharge the great movements for the salvation of men; but the actual\nproclamation of the gospel is performed by the servants of Christ\nupon the earth.\nFaithful men, who were obedient to the promptings of God’s\nSpirit and the teachings of His word, were to proclaim this warning\nto the world. They were those who had taken heed to the “sure word\nof prophecy,” the “light that shineth in a dark place, until the day\ndawn, and the day star arise.” 2 Peter 1:19.

And the\napostle Paul, speaking by the Spirit of Inspiration, testified: “The\nLord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice\nof the archangel, and with the trump of God.” 1 Thessalonians 4:16.\nSays the prophet of Patmos: “Behold, he cometh with clouds; and\nevery eye shall see him.” Revelation 1:7.\nAbout His coming cluster the glories of that “restitution of all\nthings, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets\n40\nHeshallReignForever,January13 41\nsince the world began.” Acts 3:21. Then the long-continued rule of\nevil shall be broken; “the kingdoms of this world” will become “the\nkingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever\nand ever.” Revelation 11:15."

Malachi 4:5, 6.\nThose who are to prepare the way for the second coming of\nChrist are represented by faithful Elijah, as John came in the spirit\nof Elijah to prepare the way for Christ’s first advent.\nThe work of John the Baptist, and the work of those who in the\nlast days go forth in the spirit and power of Elijah to arouse the\npeople from their apathy, are in many respects the same. His work\nis a type of the work that must be done in this age.

His diet, purely vegetable, of locusts\nand wild honey, was a rebuke to the indulgence of appetite and the\ngluttony that everywhere prevailed. ... The great subject of reform\nis to be agitated, and the public mind is to be stirred. Temperance\nin all things is to be connected with the message, to turn the people\nof God from their idolatry, their gluttony, and their extravagance in\ndress and other things.\nThe self-denial, humility, and temperance required of the righ-\nteous, whom God especially leads and blesses, is to be presented to\nthe people in contrast to the extravagant, health-destroying habits\nof those who live in this degenerate age. God has shown that health\nreform is as closely connected with the third angel’s message as the\nhand is with the body.\nAs John the Baptist ... called their attention to the Ten Com-\nmandments, so we are to give, with no uncertain sound, the message:\n42\nElijahProphecy,January14 43\n“Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is\ncome.” With the earnestness that characterized Elijah the prophet\nand John the Baptist, we are to strive to prepare the way for Christ’s\nsecond advent."

Revelation 16:15.\nThe evil servant says in his heart, “My lord delayeth his coming.”\nHe does not say that Christ will not come. He does not scoff at the\nidea of His second coming. But in his heart and by his actions and\nwords he declares that the Lord’s coming is delayed. He banishes\nfrom the mind of others the conviction that the Lord is coming\nquickly. His influence leads men to presumptuous, careless delay....\nHe mingles with the world....It is a fearful assimilation. With the\nworld he is taken in the snare....\n“If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief,\nandthoushaltnotknowwhathourIwillcomeuponthee.”Revelation\n3:3. The advent of Christ will surprise the false teachers. They are\nsaying, “Peace and safety.” Like the priests and teachers before the\nfall of Jerusalem, they look for the church to enjoy earthly prosperity\nand glory. The signs of the times they interpret as foreshadowing\nthis. But what saith the word of Inspiration? “Sudden destruction\ncometh upon them.” 1 Thessalonians 5:3. Upon all who dwell on the\nface of the whole earth, upon all who make this world their home,\nthe day of God will come as a snare....\nThe world, full of rioting, full of godless pleasure, is asleep,\nasleep in carnal security. Men are putting afar off the coming of\nthe Lord. They laugh at warnings. The proud boast is made, “All\nthings continue as they were from the beginning.” “Tomorrow shall\nbe as this day, and much more abundant.” 2 Peter 3:4; Isaiah 56:12.\nWe will go deeper into pleasure loving. But Christ says, “Behold,\nI come as a thief.” Revelation 16:15. At the very time when the\nworld is asking in scorn, “Where is the promise of his coming?”\nthe signs are fulfilling. While they cry, “Peace and safety,” sudden\ndestruction is coming. When the scorner, the rejecter of truth, has\n66\nPresumptuous,CarelessDelay,January26 67\nbecome presumptuous; when the routine of work in the various\nmoney-making lines is carried on without regard to principle; when\nthe student is eagerly seeking knowledge of everything but his Bible,\nChrist comes as a thief."

Luke 12:37.\nGod has always given men warning of coming judgments. Those\nwho had faith in His message for their time, and who acted out their\nfaith, in obedience to His commandments, escaped the judgments\nthat fell upon the disobedient and unbelieving. The word came to\nNoah, “Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have\nI seen righteous before me.” Noah obeyed and was saved. The\nmessage came to Lot, “Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord\nwill destroy this city.” Genesis 7:1; 19:14. Lot placed himself under\nthe guardianship of the heavenly messengers, and was saved. So\nChrist’sdisciplesweregivenwarningofthedestructionofJerusalem.\nThose who watched for the sign of the coming ruin, and fled from\nthe city, escaped the destruction. So now we are given warning of\nChrist’s second coming and of the destruction to fall upon the world.\nThose who heed the warning will be saved.\nBecause we know not the exact time of His coming, we are\ncommanded to watch. “Blessed are those servants, whom the lord\nwhen he cometh shall find watching.” Luke 12:37. Those who\nwatch for the Lord’s coming are not waiting in idle expectancy. The\nexpectation of Christ’s coming is to make men fear the Lord, and\nfear His judgments upon transgression. It is to awaken them to the\ngreat sin of rejecting His offers of mercy. Those who are watching\nfor the Lord are purifying their souls by obedience to the truth.\nWith vigilant watching they combine earnest working. Because\nthey know that the Lord is at the door, their zeal is quickened to\nco-operate with the divine intelligences in working for the salvation\nof souls. These are the faithful and wise servants who give to the\nLord’s household “their portion of meat in due season.” Luke 12:42.\n70\nBlessingsUpontheWatchfulOnes,January28 71\nThey are declaring the truth that is now specially applicable.

The\nheavenly character must be acquired on earth, or it can never be\nacquired at all.\nDesires for goodness and true holiness are right so far as they go;\nbut if you stop here, they will avail nothing. Good purposes are right,\nbut will prove of no avail unless resolutely carried out. Many will\nbe lost while hoping and desiring to be Christians; but they made\nno earnest effort, therefore they will be weighed in the balances and\nfound wanting. The will must be exercised in the right direction. I\n92\nFeastthatSatisfies,February7 93\nwill be a wholehearted Christian. I will know the length and breadth,\nthe height and depth, of perfect love.\nListen to the words of Jesus: “Blessed are they which do hunger\nand thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.” Ample provi-\nsions are made by Christ to satisfy the soul that hungers and thirsts\nfor righteousness."

    "content": "Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some\nshall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and\ndoctrines of devils. 1 Timothy 4:1.\nAfter the passing of the time in 1844, we had fanaticism of every\nkind to meet.... The experience of the past will be repeated. In the\nfuture Satan’s superstitions will assume new forms. Errors will be\npresented in a pleasing and flattering manner. False theories, clothed\nwith garments of light, will be presented to God’s people. Thus\nSatan will try to deceive, if possible, the very elect. Most seducing\ninfluences will be exerted; minds will be hypnotized.\nCorruptions of every type, similar to those existing among the\nantediluvians, will be brought in to take minds captive. The exalta-\ntion of nature as God, the unrestrained license of the human will, the\ncounsel of the ungodly—these Satan uses as his agencies to bring\nabout certain ends. He will employ the power of mind over mind to\ncarry out his designs. The most sorrowful thought of all is that under\nhis deceptive influence men will have a form of godliness, without\nhaving a real connection with God. Like Adam and Eve, who ate\nthe fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, many are\neven now feeding upon the deceptive morsels of error.\nSatanic agencies are clothing false theories in an attractive garb,\neven as Satan in the Garden of Eden concealed his identity from our\nfirst parents by speaking through the serpent. These agencies are\ninstilling into human minds that which in reality is deadly error. The\nhypnotic influence of Satan will rest upon those who turn from the\nplain word of God to pleasing fables.\nIt is those who have had the most light that Satan most assidu-\nously seeks to ensnare. He knows that if he can deceive them, they\nwill, under his control, clothe sin with garments of righteousness,\nand lead many astray.\n118\nBewareofSatan’sAgents,February20 119\nI say to all: Be on your guard; for as an angel of light Satan is\nwalking in everyassemblyofChristian workers, andin everychurch,\ntrying to win the members to his side. I am bidden to give to the\npeople of God the warning: “Be not deceived; God is not mocked.”\nGalatians 6:7."

Also of your own\nselves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away\ndisciples after them. Acts 20:29, 30.\nGod has not passed His people by and chosen one solitary man\nhere and another there as the only ones worthy to be entrusted\nwith His truth. He does not give one man new light contrary to\nthe established faith of the body. In every reform men have arisen\nmaking this claim....\nOne accepts some new and original idea which does not seem to\nconflict with the truth. He ... dwells upon it until it seems to him to\nbe clothed with beauty and importance, for Satan has power to give\nthis false appearance. At last it becomes the all-absorbing theme,\nthe one great point around which everything centers; and the truth is\nuprooted from the heart....\nI warn you to beware of these side issues, whose tendency is\nto divert the mind from the truth. Error is never harmless. It never\nsanctifies, but always brings confusion and dissension....\nThere are a thousand temptations in disguise prepared for those\nwho have the light of truth; and the only safety for any of us is in\nreceiving no new doctrine, no new interpretation of the Scriptures,\nwithout first submitting it to brethren of experience. Lay it before\nthem in a humble, teachable spirit, with earnest prayer; and if they\nsee no light in it, yield to their judgment....\nSatan is constantly at work; but few have any idea of his activity\nand subtlety. The people of God must be prepared to withstand the\nwily foe. It is this resistance that Satan dreads. He knows better than\nwe do the limit of his power and how easily he can be overcome if\nwe resist and face him. Through divine strength the weakest saint\nis more than a match for him and all his angels, and if brought to\nthe test he would be able to prove his superior power. Therefore\n120\nTemptationsinDisguise,February21 121\nSatan’s step is noiseless, his movements stealthy, and his batteries\nmasked. He does not venture to show himself openly, lest he arouse\nthe Christian’s dormant energies and send him to God in prayer."

Thus it has always been presented to me. It is true that\ntime has continued longer than we expected in the early days of this\nmessage. Our Saviour did not appear as soon as we hoped. But has\nthe word of the Lord failed? Never! It should be remembered that\nthe promises and threatenings of God are alike conditional.\nGod had committed to His people a work to be accomplished\non earth. The third angel’s message was to be given, the minds of\nbelievers were to be directed to the heavenly sanctuary, where Christ\nhad entered to make atonement for His people. The Sabbath reform\nwas to be carried forward. The breach in the law of God must be\nmade up. The message must be proclaimed with a loud voice, that\nall the inhabitants of earth might receive the warning. The people of\nGod must purify their souls through obedience to the truth, and be\nprepared to stand without fault before Him at His coming.\nHad Adventists, after the great disappointment in 1844, held\nfast their faith, and followed on unitedly in the opening providence\nof God, receiving the message of the third angel and in the power\nof the Holy Spirit proclaiming it to the world, ...the Lord would\nhave wrought mightily with their efforts, the work would have been\ncompleted, and Christ would have come ere this to receive His\npeople to their reward.\nBut in the period of doubt and uncertainty that followed the\ndisappointment, many of the advent believers yielded their faith....\nThus the work was hindered, and the world was left in darkness....\nFor forty years did unbelief, murmuring, and rebellion shut out\nancient Israel from the land of Canaan. The same sins have delayed\nthe entrance of modern Israel into the heavenly Canaan. In neither\ncase were the promises of God at fault. It is the unbelief, the world-\n122\nWhyChristDelaysHisComing,February22 123\nliness, unconsecration, and strife among the Lord’s professed people\nthat have kept us in this world of sin and sorrow so many years."

He knew\nthat all who would be fitted to meet Christ in peace, must possess a\npure and holy character.\nIf Seventh-day Adventists practiced what they profess to believe,\nif they were sincere health reformers, they would indeed be a spec-\ntacle to the world, to angels, and to men.

But those who are slaves to appetite will fail in perfecting\nChristian character. The continual transgression of man for six thou-\nsand years has brought sickness, pain, and death as its fruits.

Matthew\n13:45, 46.\nChrist Himself is the pearl of great price.... The righteousness of\nChrist, as a pure, white pearl, has no defect, no stain. No work of\nman can improve the great and precious gift of God. It is without a\nflaw. In Christ are “hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.”\nColossians 2:3. He is “made unto us wisdom, and righteousness,\nand sanctification, and redemption.” 1 Corinthians 1:30. All that can\nsatisfy the needs and longings of the human soul, for this world and\nfor the world to come, is found in Christ. Our Redeemer is the pearl\nso precious that in comparison all things else may be accounted\nloss....\nIn the parable the pearl is not represented as a gift. The mer-\nchantman bought it at the price of all that he had. Many question the\nmeaning of this, since Christ is represented in the Scriptures as a gift.\nHe is a gift, but only to those who give themselves, soul, body, and\nspirit, to Him without reserve. We are to give ourselves to Christ, to\nlive a life of willing obedience to all His requirements. All that we\nare, all the talents and capabilities we possess, are the Lord’s, to be\nconsecrated to His service. When we thus give ourselves wholly to\nHim, Christ, with all the treasures of heaven, gives Himself to us.\nWe obtain the pearl of great price....\nIn the market of which divine mercy has the management, the\nprecious pearl is represented as being bought without money and\nwithout price. In this market all may obtain the goods of heaven.\nThe treasury of the jewels of truth is open to all.... The Saviour’s\nvoice earnestly and lovingly invites us: “I counsel thee to buy of Me\ngold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich.” ... The poorest are\nas well able as the richest to purchase salvation; for no amount of\n146\nHeaven’sFlawlessPearl,March5 147\nworldly wealth can secure it. It is obtained by willing obedience, by\ngiving ourselves to Christ as His own purchased possession....\nWe cannot earn salvation, but we are to seek for it with as much\ninterest and perseverance as though we would abandon everything\nin the world for it."

To the\nchurch it is given “that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and\nwhite,” “not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.” Revelation\n19:8; Ephesians 5:27.

A close sympathy exists\nbetween the physical and the moral nature. The standard of virtue is\nelevated or degraded by the physical habits. Excessive eating of the\nbest of food will produce a morbid condition of the moral feelings.\nAnd if the food is not the most healthful, the effects will be still more\ninjurious.

He knew that the indulgence of perverted\nappetite would so deaden man’s perceptions that sacred things could\nnot be discerned....

James\n1:6.\nPrayer and faith are closely allied, and they need to be studied\ntogether. In the prayer of faith there is a divine science; it is a\nscience that everyone who would make his life-work a success must\nunderstand. Christ says, “What things soever ye desire, when ye\npray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.” Mark\n11:24. He makes it plain that our asking must be according to God’s\nwill; we must ask for the things that He has promised, and whatever\nwe receive must be used in doing His will. The conditions met, the\npromise is unequivocal.\nFor the pardon of sin, for the Holy Spirit, for a Christlike tem-\nper, for wisdom and strength to do His work, for any gift He has\npromised, we may ask; then we are to believe that we receive, and\nreturn thanks to God that we have received. We need look for no\noutward evidence of the blessing. The gift is in the promise, and we\nmay go about our work assured that what God has promised He is\nable to perform, and that the gift, which we already possess, will be\nrealized when we need it most.\nTo live thus by the word of God means the surrender to Him\nof the whole life. There will be felt a continual sense of need\nand dependence, a drawing out of the heart after God. Prayer is\na necessity; for it is the life of the soul. Family prayer, public prayer,\nhave their place; but it is secret communion with God that sustains\nthe soul life....\nAn intensity such as never before was seen is taking possession\nof the world.

They are to be co-laborers with God in the work of\nwinning souls to Christ.\nThe theme that attracts the heart of the sinner is Christ, and Him\ncrucified. On the cross of Calvary, Jesus stands revealed to the world\nin unparalleled love. Present Him thus to the hungering multitudes,\nand the light of His love will win men from darkness to light, from\ntransgression to obedience and true holiness.

If we can awaken an interest in men’s minds that will cause\nthem to fix their eyes on Christ, we may step aside, and ask them\nonly to continue to fix their eyes upon the Lamb of God....

Luke 9:23.\nThe sin which is indulged to the greatest extent, and which\nseparates us from God and produces so many contagious spiritual\ndisorders, is selfishness. There can be no returning to the Lord\nexcept by self-denial. Of ourselves we can do nothing; but, through\nGod strengthening us, we can live to do good to others, and in this\nway shun the evil of selfishness. We need not go to heathen lands to\nmanifest our desire to devote all to God in a useful, unselfish life.\nWe should do this in the home circle, in the church, among those\nwith whom we associate and with whom we do business. Right in\nthe common walks of life is where self is to be denied and kept in\nsubordination.\nPaul could say: “I die daily.” It is the daily dying to self in the\nlittle transactions of life that makes us overcomers. We should forget\nself in the desire to do good to others. With many there is a decided\nlack of love for others. Instead of faithfully performing their duty,\nthey seek rather their own pleasure.\nGod positively enjoins upon all His followers a duty to bless\nothers with their influence and means, and to seek that wisdom of\nHim which will enable them to do all in their power to elevate the\nthoughts and affections of those who come within their influence. In\ndoing for others, a sweet satisfaction will be experienced, an inward\npeace which will be a sufficient reward. When actuated by a high\nand noble desire to do others good, they will find true happiness in\na faithful discharge of life’s manifold duties. This will bring more\nthan an earthly reward; for every faithful, unselfish performance of\nduty is noticed by the angels and shines in the life record.\nIn heaven none willthinkofself, norseektheirown pleasure; but\nall, from pure, genuine love, will seek the happiness of the heavenly\n222\nLivingtoSaveOthers,April11 223\nbeings around them. If we wish to enjoy heavenly society in the\nearth made new, we must be governed by heavenly principles here.\nThe greatest work that can be done in our world is to glorify God\nby living the character of Christ."

Whether it be the treasures\nof wealth or of intellect, they are to be laid, a willing offering, at the\nfeet of Jesus.\nIn commissioning His disciples to go “into all the world, and\npreach the gospel to every creature,” Christ assigned to men the\nwork of extending the knowledge of His grace. But while some go\nforth to preach, He calls upon others ... for offerings with which to\nsupport His cause in the earth.\nNot all can make large offerings, not all can do great works,\nmagnificent deeds; but all can practice self-denial, all can reveal\nthe unselfishness of the Saviour. Some can bring large gifts to the\nLord’s treasury; others can bring only mites; but every gift brought\nin sincerity is accepted by the Lord.\nMany would be surprised to see how much could be saved for\nthe cause of God by acts of self-denial.

The doctrine that all were\nholy had led to the belief that the affections of the sanctified were\nnever in danger of leading astray. The result of this belief was the\nfulfillment of the evil desires of hearts which, though professedly\nsanctified, were far from purity of thought and practice.\nThis is only one of the instances in which I was called upon to\nrebuke those who were presenting the doctrine of an impersonal god\ndiffused through nature, and the doctrine of holy flesh.\nIn the future, truth will be counterfeited by the precepts of men.\nDeceptive theories will be presented as safe doctrines. False science\nis one of the agencies that Satan used in the heavenly courts, and it\nis used by him today....\nI beseech those who are laboring for God not to accept the spuri-\nous for the genuine. We have a whole Bible full of the most precious\ntruth. We have no need for supposition or false excitement. In the\ngolden censer of truth, as presented in Christ’s teachings, we have\nthat which will convict and convert souls.

The result was the papacy, a church that controlled the power\nof the state and employed it to further her own ends, especially for\nthe punishment of “heresy.”...\nWhenever the church has obtained secular power, she has em-\nployed it to punish dissent from her doctrines.

An example of this is given in the long-continued\npersecution of dissenters by the Church of England. During the\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries, thousands of nonconformist\nministers were forced to flee from their churches, and many, both of\npastors and people, were subjected to fine, imprisonment, torture,\nand martyrdom.\nIt was apostasy that led the early church to seek the aid of the\ncivil government, and this prepared the way for the development\nof the papacy—the beast.

Here is a\nthreefold message represented as proclaimed by heavenly beings\nand immediately followed by the coming of the Son of man to reap\n“the harvest of the earth.”\nThe angels are represented as flying in the midst of heaven,\nproclaiming to the world a message of warning, and having a direct\nbearing upon the people living in the last days of this earth’s history.\nNo one hears the voice of these angels, for they are a symbol to\nrepresent the people of God who are working in harmony with the\nuniverse of heaven.\nThe three angels’ messages are to be combined, giving their\nthreefold light to the world. In the Revelation, John says, “I saw\nanother angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the\nearth was lightened with his glory.”... This represents the giving of\nthe last and threefold message of warning to the world.\nRevelation 18 points to the time when, as the result of rejecting\nthe threefold warning of Revelation 14:6-12, the church will have\nfully reached the condition foretold by the second angel, and the\npeople of God still in Babylon will be called upon to separate from\nher communion.

And in heaven we\nare continually to improve....\nMental ability and genius are not character, for these are often\npossessed by those who have the very opposite of a good character.\nReputation is not character. True character is a quality of the soul,\nrevealing itself in the conduct.\nA good character is a capital of more value than gold or silver.\nIt is unaffected by panics or failures, and in that day when earthly\npossessions shall be swept away, it will bring rich returns. Integrity,\nfirmness, andperseverancearequalitiesthatallshouldseekearnestly\nto cultivate; for they clothe the possessor with a power which is\nirresistible—a power which makes him strong to do good, strong to\nresist evil, strong to bear adversity.\nStrength of character consists of two things—power of will and\npower of self-control. Many youth mistake strong, uncontrolled\npassion for strength of character; but the truth is that he who is\nmastered by his passions is a weak man. The real greatness and\nnobility of the man is measured by his powers to subdue his feelings,\nnot by the power of his feelings to subdue him. The strongest man\nis he who, while sensitive to abuse, will yet restrain passion and\nforgive his enemies.\nIf it were considered as important that the young possess a beau-\ntiful character and amiable disposition as it is that they imitate the\nfashions of the world in dress and deportment, we would see hun-\ndreds where there is one today coming upon the stage of active life\nprepared to exert an ennobling influence upon society.\n456"

When this mighty change has\ntaken place in the sinner, he has passed from death unto life, from\nsin unto holiness, from transgression and rebellion to obedience and\nloyalty....\nErroneous theories of sanctification, ... springing from neglect\nor rejection of the divine law, have a prominent place in the religious\nmovements of the day. These theories are both false in doctrine\nand dangerous in practical results; and the fact that they are so\ngenerally finding favor, renders it doubly essential that all have a\nclear understanding of what the Scriptures teach upon this point.\nTrue sanctification is a Bible doctrine. The apostle Paul, in his\nletter to the Thessalonian church, declares: “This is the will of God,\neven your sanctification.” And he prays: “The very God of peace\nsanctify you wholly” (1 Thessalonians 4:3; 5:23). The Bible clearly\nteaches what sanctification is and how it is to be attained. The\nSaviour prayed for His disciples: “Sanctify them through thy truth:\nthy word is truth” (John 17:17, 19). And Paul teaches that believers\nare to be “sanctified by the Holy Ghost” (Romans 15:16). What\nis the work of the Holy Spirit? Jesus told His disciples: “When\nhe, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth”\n(John 16:13). And the psalmist says: “Thy law is the truth.” By the\nWord and the Spirit of God are opened to men the great principles\nof righteousness embodied in His law. And since the law of God is\n“holy, and just, and good,” a transcript of the divine perfection, it\nfollows that a character formed by obedience to that law will be holy.\nChrist is a perfect example of such a character. He says: “I have kept\nmy Father’s commandments.” “I do always those things that please\nhim” (John 15:10; 8:29). The followers of Christ are to become like\n471\n472 Maranatha\nHim—by the grace of God to form characters in harmony with the\nprinciples of His holy law. This is Bible sanctification.\nThis work can be accomplished only through faith in Christ, by\nthe power of the indwelling Spirit of God."

Isaiah\n6:5.\nThose who experience the sanctification of the Bible will man-\nifest a spirit of humility. Like Moses, they have had a view of the\nawful majesty of holiness, and they see their own unworthiness in\ncontrast with the purity and exalted perfection of the Infinite One.\nThe prophet Daniel was an example of true sanctification. His\nlong life was filled up with noble service for his Master. He was\na man “greatly beloved” (Daniel 10:11) of Heaven. Yet instead of\nclaiming to be pure and holy, this honored prophet identified himself\nwith the really sinful of Israel as he pleaded before God in behalf\nof his people: “We do not present our supplications before thee for\nour righteousness, but for thy great mercies.” “We have sinned, we\nhave done wickedly.” He declares: “I was speaking, and praying,\nand confessing my sin and the sin of my people.... “(Daniel 9:18,\n15, 20).\nWhen Job heard the voice of the Lord out of the whirlwind, he\nexclaimed: “I abhormyself, andrepentin dustandashes” (Job42:6).\nItwas when Isaiahsawthe gloryofthe Lord, andheardthe cherubim\ncrying, “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts,” that he cried out,\n“Woe is me! for I am undone” (Isaiah 6:3, 5). Paul, after he was\ncaught up into the third heaven and heard things which it was not\npossible for a man to utter, speaks of himself as “less than the least\nof all saints” (2 Corinthians 12:2-4, margin; Ephesians 3:8). It was\nthe beloved John, who leaned on Jesus’ breast and beheld His glory,\nthat fell as one dead before the feet of the angel (Revelation 1:17).\nThere can be no self-exaltation, no boastful claim to freedom\nfrom sin, on the part of those who walk in the shadow of Calvary’s\ncross. They feel that it was their sin which caused the agony that\n479\n480 Maranatha\nbroke the heart of the Son of God, and this thought will lead them to\nself-abasement. Those who live nearest to Jesus discern most clearly\nthe frailty and sinfulness of humanity, and their only hope is in the\nmerit of a crucified and risen Saviour."

Self-confidence\nled him to the belief that he was saved, and step after step was taken\nin the downward path, until he could deny his Master. Never can\nwe safely put confidence in self or feel, this side of heaven, that\nwe are secure against temptation. Those who accept the Saviour,\nhowever sincere their conversion, should never be taught to say or\nto feel that they are saved. This is misleading. Every one should be\ntaught to cherish hope and faith; but even when we give ourselves to\nChrist and know that He accepts us, we are not beyond the reach of\ntemptation.... Only he who endures the trial will receive the crown\nof life (James 1:12).\nThose who accept Christ, and in their first confidence say, I am\nsaved, are in danger of trusting to themselves.... We are admon-\nished, “Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall” (1\nCorinthians 10:12). Our only safety is in constant distrust of self,\nand dependence on Christ.\nThere are many who profess Christ, but who never become\nmature Christians. They admit that man is fallen, that his faculties\nare weakened, that he is unfitted for moral achievement, but they\nsay that Christ has borne all the burden, all the suffering, all the\nself-denial, and they are willing to let Him bear it. They say that\nthere is nothing for them to do but to believe; but Christ said, “If any\nman will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross,\nand follow me” (Matthew 16:24)....\nWe are never to rest in a satisfied condition, and cease to make\nadvancement, saying, “I am saved.” When this idea is entertained,\nthe motives for watchfulness, for prayer, for earnest endeavor to\npress onward to higher attainments, cease to exist. No sanctified\ntongue will be found uttering these words till Christ shall come, and\n481\n482 Maranatha\nwe enter in through the gates into the city of God.

    "content": "I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man\ncame with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of\ndays, and they brought him near before him. Daniel 7:13.\nAfter His ascension, our Saviour began His work as our high\npriest. Says Paul, “Christ is not entered into the holy places made\nwith hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself,\nnow to appear in the presence of God for us.” Hebrews 9:24....\nFor eighteen centuries this work of ministration continued in\nthe first apartment of the sanctuary. The blood of Christ, pleaded\nin behalf of penitent believers, secured their pardon and acceptance\nwiththe Father, yettheirsins stillremainedupon the books ofrecord.\nAs in the typical service there was a work of atonement at the close\nof the year, so before Christ’s work for the redemption of men is\ncompleted, there is a work of atonement for the removal of sin\nfrom the sanctuary. This is the service which began when the 2300\ndays ended. At that time ... our High Priest entered the most holy,\nto perform the last division of His solemn work—to cleanse the\nsanctuary....\nThe coming of Christ as our high priest to the most holy place,\nfor the cleansing of the sanctuary, brought to view in Daniel 8:14;\nthe coming of the Son of man to the Ancient of days, as presented in\nDaniel 7:13; and the coming of the Lord to His temple, foretold by\nMalachi, are descriptions of the same event; and this is also repre-\nsented by the coming of the bridegroom to the marriage, described\nby Christ in the parable of the ten virgins, of Matthew 25.\nThe cleansing of the sanctuary ... involves a work of investiga-\ntion—a work of judgment. This work must be performed prior to\nthe coming of Christ to redeem His people; for when He comes, His\nreward is with Him to give to every man according to his works.\nIn the day of final reckoning, position, rank, or wealth will not\nalter by a hair’s breadth the case of any one. By the all-seeing God,\n503\n504 Maranatha\nmen will be judged by what they are in purity, in nobility, in love\nfor Christ.\nInstruction from the Sanctuary in Heaven, August [249]\n29\nLet us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith,\nhaving our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience. Hebrews\n10:22.\n“And, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of\nheaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near\nbefore him.” Daniel 7:13.... The coming of Christ here described is\nnot His second coming to the earth. He comes to the Ancient of days\nin heaven to receive dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, which\nwill be given Him at the close of His work as a mediator. It is this\ncoming, and not His second advent to the earth, that was foretold in\nprophecy to take place at the termination of the 2300 days in 1844.\nAttended by heavenly angels, our great High Priest enters the holy\nof holies, and there appears in the presence of God ... to perform the\nwork of investigative judgment, and to make an atonement for all\nwho are shown to be entitled to its benefits.\nMay the Lord give us to see the need of drinking from the living\nfountain of the water of life. Its pure streams will refresh and heal\nus and refresh all connected with us. Oh, if the hearts were only\nsubdued by the Spirit of God! If the eye were single to God’s glory,\nwhat a flood of heavenly light would pour upon the soul. He who\nspake as never man spake was an educator upon earth. After His\nresurrection He was an educator to the lonely, disappointed disciples\ntraveling to Emmaus, and to those assembled in the upper chamber.\nHe opened to them the Scriptures concerning Himself and caused\ntheir hearts to bound with a holy, new and sacred hope and joy.\nFrom the Holy of Holies, there goes on the grand work of in-\nstruction. The angels of God are communicating to men. Christ\nofficiates in the sanctuary. We do not follow Him into the sanctuary\nas we should. Christ and angels work in the hearts of the children\nof men. The church above united with the church below is warring\n505\n506 Maranatha\nthe good warfare upon the earth. There must be a purifying of the\nsoul here upon the earth, in harmony with Christ’s cleansing of the\nsanctuary in heaven.\nGod’s people are now to have their eyes fixed on the heavenly\nsanctuary, where ... our great High Priest ... is interceding for His\npeople."

Revelation 3:3.\nAt the time appointed for the judgment—the close of the 2300\ndays, in 1844—began the work of investigation and blotting out of\nsins. All who have ever taken upon themselves the name of Christ\nmust pass its searching scrutiny. Both the living and the dead are\nto be judged “out of those things which were written in the books,\naccording to their works.” Revelation 20:12.\nSaid the Judge: “All will be justified by their faith and judged by\ntheir works.”\nSins that have not been repented of and forsaken will not be\npardoned, and blotted out of the books of record, but will stand to\nwitness against the sinner in the day of God....\nThere is earnest warfare before all who would subdue the evil\ntendencies that strive for the mastery. The work of preparation is\nan individual work. We are not saved in groups. The purity and\ndevotion of one will not offset the want of these qualities in another.\nThough all nations are to pass in judgment before God, yet He will\nexamine the case of each individual with as close and searching\nscrutiny as if there were not another being upon the earth. Every one\nmust be tested, and found without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.\nThe judgment is now passing in the sanctuary above. For many\nyears this work has been in progress. Soon—none know how soon—\nit will pass to the cases of the living. In the awful presence of God\nour lives are to come up in review. At this time above all others it\nbehooves every soul to heed the Saviour’s admonition, “Watch and\npray: for ye know not when the time is.” Mark 13:33. “If therefore\nthou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt\nnot know what hour I will come upon thee.” Revelation 3:3.\n507"

When the\ninvestigative judgment closes, Christ will come, and His reward will\nbe with Him to give to every man as his work shall be.\nAll are to be judged according to the things written in the books,\nand to be rewarded as their works have been. This judgment does\nnot take place at death.\nIn the typical service the high priest, having made the atonement\nfor Israel, came forth and blessed the congregation. So Christ, at\nthe close of His work as mediator, will appear, “without sin unto\nsalvation,” to bless His waiting people with eternal life. As the\npriest, in removing the sins from the sanctuary, confessed them upon\nthe head of the scapegoat, so Christ will place all these sins upon\nSatan, the originatorandinstigatorofsin. The scapegoat, bearing the\nsins of Israel, was sent away “unto a land not inhabited;” so Satan,\nbearing the guilt of all the sins which he has caused God’s people to\ncommit, will be for a thousand years confined to the earth, which\nwill then be desolate, without inhabitant, and he will at last suffer\nthe full penalty of sin in the fires that shall destroy all the wicked.\nA few, yes, only a few, of the vast number who people the\nearth will be saved unto life eternal, while the masses who have not\nperfected their souls in obeying the truth will be appointed to the\nsecond death.\nWhile the sins of penitent believers are being removed from the\nsanctuary, there is to be a special work of purification, of putting\naway of sin, among God’s people upon earth.\n508\nSeptember\n[252]"

God will not always be mocked; He\nwill not long be trifled with. “Behold, the day of the Lord cometh,\ncruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and\nhe shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.” Isaiah 13:9. The great\nmass of the world will reject God’s mercy, and will be overwhelmed\n526\nPeaceandSafetyCry,September9 527\nin swift and irretrievable ruin. But those who heed the warning shall\ndwell “in the secret place of the most High,” and “abide under the\nshadow of the Almighty.” His truth shall be their shield and buckler."

Matthew 24:14.\nThe solemn, sacred message of warning must be proclaimed in\nthe most difficult fields and in the most sinful cities, in every place\nwhere the light of the great threefold gospel message has not yet\ndawned. Every one is to hear the last call to the marriage supper of\nthe Lamb. From town to town, from city to city, from country to\ncountry, the message of present truth is to be proclaimed, not with\noutward display, but in the power of the Spirit.\nThe message of the renewing power of God’s grace will be\ncarried to every country and clime, until the truth shall belt the\nworld. Of the number of them that shall be sealed will be those\nwho have come from every nation and kindred and tongue and\npeople. From every country will be gathered men and women who\nwill stand before the throne of God and before the Lamb, crying,\n“Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the\nLamb.” Revelation 7:10.\nThe whole earth is to be illuminated with the glory of God’s\ntruth. The light is to shine to all lands and all peoples. And it is from\nthose who have received the light that it is to shine forth. The daystar\nhas risen upon us, and we are to flash its light upon the pathway of\nthose in darkness.\nA crisis is right upon us. We must now by the Holy Spirit’s\npower proclaim the great truths for these last days. It will not be\nlong before everyone will have heard the warning and made his\ndecision. Then shall the end come.\nThe truth contained in the first, second, and third angel’s mes-\nsages must go to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people; it must\nlighten the darkness of every continent, and extend to the islands of\nthe sea.

For, behold, the Lord cometh forth out of his\nplace, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of\nthe earth. Micah 1:2, 3.\nIt is in a crisis that character is revealed.... The great final test\ncomes at the close of human probation, when it will be too late for\nthe soul’s need to be supplied.\nGod keeps a reckoning with the nations. Through every century\nof this world’s history evil workers have been treasuring up wrath\nagainst the day of wrath; and when the time fully comes that in-\niquity shall have reached the stated boundary of God’s mercy, His\nforbearance will cease. When the accumulated figures in heaven’s\nrecord books shall mark the sum of transgression complete, wrath\nwill come, unmixed with mercy, and then it will be seen what a\ntremendous thing it is to have worn out the divine patience. This\ncrisis will be reached when the nations shall unite in making void\nGod’s law.\nThe days will come when the righteous will be stirred to zeal for\nGod because of the abounding iniquity. None but divine power can\nstay the arrogance of Satan united with evil men; but in the hour of\nthe church’s greatest danger most fervent prayer will be offered in\nher behalf by the faithful remnant, and God will hear and answer\nat the very time when the guilt of the transgressor has reached its\nheight. He will “avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto\nhim, though he bear long with them.\nThe substitution of the false for the true is the last act in the\ndrama. When this substitution becomes universal, God will reveal\nHimself. When the laws of men are exalted above the laws of God,\nwhen the powers of this earth try to force men to keep the first day\n530\nGodIntervenesonBehalfofHisPeople,September11 531\nof the week, know that the time has come for God to work. He\nwill arise in His majesty, and will shake terribly the earth. He will\ncome out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the world for their\niniquity. The earth shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover\nher slain."

The plagues upon Egypt when God was about to deliver Is-\nrael were similar in character to those more terrible and extensive\njudgments which are to fall upon the world just before the final\ndeliverance of God’s people. Says the revelator, in describing those\nterrific scourges: “There fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the\nmen which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which wor-\nshipped his image.” The sea “became as the blood of a dead man:\nand every living soul died in the sea.” And “the rivers and fountains\nof waters ...became blood.” Terrible as these inflictions are, God’s\njustice stands fully vindicated. The angel of God declares: “Thou\nart righteous, O Lord, ... because thou hast judged thus. For they\nhave shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given\nthem blood to drink; for they are worthy.” Revelation 16:2-6.

If they could have the assurance of\npardon they would not shrink from torture or death; but should they\nprove unworthy, and lose their lives because of their own defects of\ncharacter, then God’s holy name would be reproached.\nOn every hand they hear the plottings of treason and see the\nactive working of rebellion; and there is aroused within them an\nintense desire, an earnest yearning of soul, that this great apostasy\nmay be terminated and the wickedness of the wicked may come to\nan end. But while they plead with God to stay the work of rebellion,\nit is with a keen sense of self-reproach that they themselves have no\nmore power to resist and urge back the mighty tide of evil. They\nfeel that had they always employed all their ability in the service\nof Christ, going forward from strength to strength, Satan’s forces\nwould have less power to prevail against them.\nThey afflict their souls before God, pointing to their past repen-\ntance of their many sins, and pleading the Saviour’s promise: “Let\nhim take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me;\nand he shall make peace with me.” Isaiah 27:5. Their faith does not\nfail because their prayers are not immediately answered. Though\nsuffering the keenest anxiety, terror, and distress, they do not cease\ntheir intercessions. They lay hold of the strength of God as Jacob\nlaid hold of the Angel; and the language of their souls is: “I will not\nlet thee go, except thou bless me.”\n552\nWhytheTimeofTrouble,September22 553\nThe time of trouble is the crucible that is to bring out Christlike\ncharacters. It is designed to lead the people of God to renounce\nSatan and his temptations."

Luke 18:7, 8.\nIn the time of trouble, if the people of God had unconfessed sins\nto appear before them while tortured with fear and anguish, they\nwould be overwhelmed; despair would cut off their faith, and they\ncould not have confidence to plead with God for deliverance. But\nwhile they have a deep sense of their unworthiness, they have no\nconcealed wrongs to reveal. Their sins have gone beforehand to\njudgment and have been blotted out, and they cannot bring them to\nremembrance....\nThose professed Christians who come up to that last fearful\nconflict unprepared will, in their despair, confess their sins in words\nof burning anguish, while the wicked exult over their distress....\nJacob’s history is also an assurance that God will not cast off\nthose who have been deceived and tempted and betrayed into sin,\nbut who have returned unto Him with true repentance. While Satan\nseeks to destroy this class, God will send His angels to comfort and\nprotect them in the time of peril. The assaults of Satan are fierce and\ndetermined, his delusions are terrible; but the Lord’s eye is upon His\npeople, and His ear listens to their cries. Their affliction is great, the\nflames of the furnace seem about to consume them; but the Refiner\nwill bring them forth as gold tried in the fire. God’s love for His\nchildren during the period of their severest trial is as strong and\ntender as in the days of their sunniest prosperity; but it is needful\nfor them to be placed in the furnace of fire; their earthliness must be\nconsumed, that the image of Christ may be perfectly reflected.\nThe season of distress and anguish before us will require a faith\nthat can endure weariness, delay, and hunger—a faith that will not\nfaint though severely tried. The period of probation is granted to all\nto prepare for that time.... All who will lay hold of God’s promises,\n554\nGod’sEyeisUponHisPeople,September23 555\nas he [Jacob] did, and be as earnest and persevering as he was, will\nsucceed as he succeeded."

Mark 13:19.\nThe time of trouble such as never was, is soon to open upon\nus; and we shall need an experience which we do not now possess,\nand which many are too indolent to obtain. It is often the case that\ntrouble is greater in anticipation than in reality; but this is not true\nof the crisis before us. The most vivid presentation cannot reach the\nmagnitude of the ordeal. And now, while the precious Saviour is\nmaking an atonement for us, we should seek to become perfect in\nChrist. God’s providence is the school in which we are to learn the\nmeekness and lowliness of Jesus. The Lord is ever setting before us,\nnot the way we would choose, which is easier and pleasanter to us,\nbut the true aims of life. None can neglect or defer this work but at\nthe most fearful peril to their souls.\nThe apostle John in vision heard a loud voice in Heaven ex-\nclaiming, “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for\nthe devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he\nknoweth that he hath but a short time.” Fearful are the scenes which\ncall forth this exclamation from the heavenly voice. The wrath of\nSatan increases as his time grows short, and his work of deceit and\ndestruction reaches its culmination in the time of trouble. God’s\nlong-suffering has ended. The world has rejected His mercy, de-\nspised His love, and trampled upon His law. The wicked have passed\nthe boundary of their probation, and the Lord withdraws His protec-\ntion, and leaves them to the mercy of the leader they have chosen.\nSatan will have power over those who have yielded themselves to\nhis control, and he will plunge the inhabitants of the earth into one\ngreat, final trouble. As the angels of God cease to hold in check the\nfierce winds of human passion, all the elements of strife will be let\n556\nGreatTimeofTrouble,September24 557\nloose.

They themselves begin to fear that the Lord has left them to\nfall by the hand of their enemies. It is a time of fearful agony. Day\nand night they cry unto God for deliverance....\nThe eye of God, looking down the ages, was fixed upon the crisis\nwhich His people are to meet, when earthly powers shall be arrayed\nagainst them. Like the captive exile, they will be in fear of death\nby starvation or by violence.

If the blood of Christ’s\nfaithful witnesses were shed at this time, it would not, like the blood\nof the martyrs, be as seed sown to yield a harvest for God.

Isaiah 13:13, 14.\nThick clouds still cover the sky; yet the sun now and then breaks\nthrough, appearing like the avenging eye of Jehovah.

The words spoken are not com-\nprehended by all; but they are distinctly understood by the false\nteachers. Those who a little before were so reckless, so boastful and\ndefiant, so exultant in their cruelty to God’s commandment-keeping\npeople, are now overwhelmed with consternation and shuddering in\nfear. Their wails are heard above the sound of the elements. Demons\nacknowledge the deity ofChristandtremble before His power, while\nmen are supplicating for mercy and groveling in abject terror....\nThrough a rift in the clouds there beams a star whose brilliancy\nis increased fourfold in contrast with the darkness. It speaks hope\nand joy to the faithful, but severity and wrath to the transgressors\nof God’s law. Those who have sacrificed all for Christ are now\nsecure, hidden as in the secret of the Lord’s pavilion. They have\nbeen tested, and before the world and the despisers of truth they\nhave evinced their fidelity to Him who died for them. A marvelous\nchange has come over those who have held fast their integrity in the\nvery face of death. They have been suddenly delivered from the dark\nand terrible tyranny of men transformed to demons. Their faces, so\nlately pale, anxious, and haggard, are now aglow with wonder, faith,\nand love. Their voices rise in triumphant song: “God is our refuge\nand strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we\nfear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be\ncarried into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and\n578\nEarthFleesfromitsMaker,October4 579\nbe troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.”\nPsalm 46:1-3."

Job 19:25-27.\nOur personal identity is preserved in the resurrection, though not\nthe same particles of matter or material substance as went into the\ngrave. The wondrous works of God are a mystery to man. The spirit,\nthe character of man, is returned to God, there to be preserved. In\nthe resurrection every man will have his own character. God in His\nown time will call forth the dead, giving again the breath of life, and\nbidding the dry bones live. The same form will come forth, but it\nwill be free from disease and every defect. It lives again bearing the\nsame individuality of features, so that friend will recognize friend.\nThere is no law of God in nature which shows that God gives back\nthe same identical particles of matter which composed the body\nbefore death.

His love\nwill call forth a response from them, and their lives will show to\nthose around them that the Spirit of God is controlling them, that\nthey are setting their affections on things above, not on the things of\nthe earth.\nIn thinking of heaven, we may put our imagination to the utmost\nstretchandthinkthe loftiestthoughts thatwe are capable ofthinking,\nand our minds will grow weary in the effort to comprehend the\nbreadth and depth and height of the subject. It is impossible for our\nminds to take in the great themes of eternity. It is impossible for\nus even to make an effort to understand these things without the\neffort affecting our whole character for good and having an uplifting\ninfluence on our minds. As we think of how Christ came to our\nworld to die for fallen man, we understand something of the price\nthat was paid for our redemption, and we realize that there is no true\ngoodness or greatness apart from God.\nOnly by the light shining from the cross of Calvary can we know\nto what depths of sin and degradation the human race has fallen\nthrough sin. Only by the length of the chain let down from heaven to\ndraw us up can we know the depths to which we had sunk. And it is\nonly by keeping the unseen realities in view that we can understand\nanything of the wonderful theme of redemption.\nWe are almost home; we shall soon hear the voice of the Saviour\nricher than any music, saying, Your warfare is accomplished. Enter\ninto the joy of thy Lord. Blessed, blessed benediction; I want to hear\nit from His immortal lips. I want to praise Him; I want to honor\n654\nSetYourAffectionsonThingsAbove,November10 655\nHim that sitteth on the throne. I want my voice to echo and re-echo\nthrough the courts of heaven.

They have\nbeen partakers with Christ in His sufferings, they have been workers\ntogether with Him in the plan of redemption, and they are partakers\nwith Him in the joy of seeing souls saved in the kingdom of God,\nthere to praise God through all eternity.\nIn that day the redeemed will shine forth in the glory of the\nFather and the Son.

We must outgrow our childishness. When provocation\ncomes let us be silent. There are times when silence is eloquence.\nWe are to reveal the patience and kindness and forbearance that will\nmake us worthy of being called sons and daughters of God. We are\nto trust Him, and believe on Him, and rely upon Him. We are to\nfollow in Christ’s steps. “If any man will come after me,” He says,\n“let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me”\n(Luke 9:23).... Itmay be a heavy cross to keep silentwhen you ought\nto. It may be a painful discipline, but let me assure you that silence\ndoes much more to overcome evil than a storm of angry words.\nHere in this world we are to learn what we must be in order to\nhave a place in the heavenly courts. We are to learn the lessons that\nChrist desires to teach us, that we may be prepared to be taken to\nthe higher school in the courts above, where the Saviour will lead\nus beside the river of life, explaining to us many things that here\nwe could not comprehend.... There we shall see the glory of God as\nwe have never seen it here. We get but a glimpse of the glory now,\nbecause we do not follow on to know the Lord.\nEvery right principle, every truth learned in an earthly school,\nwill advance us just that much in the heavenly school. As Christ\nwalked and talked with His disciples during His ministry on this\nearth, so will He teach us in the school above, leading us beside\nthe river of living waters, and revealing to us truths that in this\nlife must remain hidden mysteries because of the limitations of the\nhuman mind, so marred by sin. In the heavenly school we shall have\nopportunity to attain, step by step, to the greatest heights of learning.\nThere, as children of the heavenly King, we shall ever dwell with\n664\nWeShallSeetheKing,November15 665\nthe members of the royal family; there we shall see the King in His\nbeauty, and behold His matchless charms.\nLong have we waited, but our hope is not to grow dim. If we can\nbut see the King in His beauty we shall be forever blessed.\n[328] The One Hundred Forty-Four Thousand, November\n16\nI looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with\nhim an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father’s\nname written in their foreheads. Revelation 14:1.\nUpon the crystal sea before the throne, that sea of glass as it were\nmingled with fire—so resplendent is it with the glory of God—are\ngathered the company that have “gotten the victory over the beast,\nand over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of\nhis name.” With the Lamb upon Mount Zion, “having the harps of\nGod,” they stand, the hundred and forty and four thousand that were\nredeemed from among men; and there is heard, as the sound of many\nwaters, and as the sound of a great thunder, “the voice of harpers\nharping with their harps.” And they sing “a new song” before the\nthrone, a song which no man can learn save the hundred and forty\nand four thousand. It is the song of Moses and the Lamb—a song of\ndeliverance.\nNone but the hundred and forty-four thousand can learn that\nsong; for it is the song of their experience—an experience such as\nno other company have ever had. “These are they which follow the\nLamb whithersoever he goeth.” These, having been translated from\nthe earth, from among the living, are counted as “the firstfruits unto\nGod and to the Lamb.” Revelation 15:2, 3; 14:1-5. “These are they\nwhich came out of great tribulation;” they have passed through the\ntime of trouble such as never was since there was a nation; they\nhave endured the anguish of the time of Jacob’s trouble; they have\nstood without an intercessor through the final outpouring of God’s\njudgments. But they have been delivered, for they have “washed\ntheir robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.” “In\ntheir mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault” before\nGod. “Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him\n666\nOneHundredForty-FourThousand,November16 667\nday and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall\ndwell among them.”\nThey have seen the earth wasted with famine and pestilence, the\nsun having powerto scorchmen withgreatheat, andtheythemselves\nhave endured suffering, hunger, and thirst. But “they shall hunger\nno more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them,\nnor any heat.” Revelation 7:14-16.\n[329] The Great Multitude of the Redeemed, November\n17\nAfter this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man\ncould number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and\ntongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed\nwith white robes, and palms in their hands. Revelation 7:9.\nAll classes, all nations and kindreds and people and tongues will\nstand before the throne of God and the Lamb with their spotless\nrobes and jeweled crowns. Said the angel, These are they that have\ncome up through great tribulation and have washed their robes and\nmade them white, while the lovers of pleasure more than lovers of\nGod, the self-indulgent and disobedient, have lost both worlds. They\nhave neither the things of this life nor the immortal life.\nThat triumphant throng, with songs of victory and with crowns\nandharps, havetrodden in thefieryfurnaceofearthlyaffliction when\nit was heated and intensely hot. From destitution, from hunger and\ntorture, they come, from deep self-denial and bitter disappointments.\nLook upon them now as conquerors, no longer poor, no longer in\nsorrow, in affliction and hated of all men for Christ’s sake. Behold\ntheir heavenly garments, white and shining, richer than any kingly\nrobe. Look by faith upon their jeweled crowns; never did such a\ndiadem deck the brow of any earthly monarch.\nListen to their voices as they sing loud hosannas and as they\nwave the palm branches of victory. Rich music fills heaven as their\nvoices sing forth these words: “Worthy, worthy is the Lamb that was\nslain and rose again forevermore. Salvation unto our God which\nsitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.” And the angelic host,\nangels and archangels, covering cherub and glorious seraph, echo\nback the refrain of that joyous, triumphant song saying, “Amen:\nBlessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and\npower, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever” (Revelation\n7:12).\n668\nGreatMultitudeoftheRedeemed,November17 669\nOh, in that day it will be discovered that the righteous were the\nwise ones, while the sinful and disobedient were fools.... Shame\nand everlasting contempt is their portion. Those who have been\ncolaborers for Christ will then be near the throne of God, girt with\npurity and the garments of eternal righteousness."

Malachi 4:1.\nNotwithstanding thatSatan has been constrained to acknowledge\nGod’s justice and to bow to the supremacy of Christ, his character\nremains unchanged. The spirit of rebellion, like a mighty torrent,\nagain bursts forth. Filled with frenzy, he determines not to yield the\ngreat controversy.

He rushes into the midst of his subjects\nand endeavors to inspire them with his own fury and arouse them to\ninstant battle. But of all the countless millions whom he has allured\ninto rebellion, there are none now to acknowledge his supremacy.\nHis power is at an end. The wicked are filled with the same hatred of\nGod that inspires Satan; but they see that their case is hopeless, that\nthey cannot prevail against Jehovah. Their rage is kindled against\nSatan and those who have been his agents in deception, and with the\nfury of demons they turn upon them.\nSaith the Lord: “Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of\nGod; behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible\nof the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty\nof thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.

To us the effortmayseem to\nbe lost.

Her example of self-sacrifice has\nactedandreactedupon thousands ofhearts in everylandandin every\nage. It has brought to the treasury of God gifts from the high and\nthe low, the rich and the poor. It has helped to sustain missions, to\nestablish hospitals, to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, heal the\nsick, andpreachthe gospelto the poor. Multitudes have been blessed\nthrough her unselfish deed. And the outworking of all these lines of\ninfluence she, in the day of God, will be permitted to see. So with\nMary’s precious gift to the Saviour. How many have been inspired\nto loving service by the memory of that broken alabaster box! And\nhow she will rejoice as she beholds all this!\n“Verily I say unto you,” Christ declared, “Wheresoever this\ngospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that\nshe hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.” Looking\ninto the future, the Saviour spoke with certainty concerning His\ngospel. It was to be preached throughout the world. And as far as\nthe gospel extended, Mary’s gift would shed its fragrance, and hearts\nwould be blessed through her unstudied act. Kingdoms would rise\nand fall; the names of monarchs and conquerors would be forgotten;\nbut this woman’s deed would be immortalized upon the pages of\nsacred history. Until time should be no more, that broken alabaster\nbox would tell the story of the abundant love of God for a fallen\nrace.\n728\nUnexpectedRecompense,December17 729\nEvery impulse of the Holy Spirit leading men to goodness and to\nGod is noted in the books of heaven, and in the day of God everyone\nwho has given himself as an instrument forthe Holy Spirit’s working\nwill be permitted to behold what his life has wrought."

As\nthe inhabitants of these worlds see the great price that has been paid\nto ransom man, they are filled with amazement.\nThe Lord has given me a view of other worlds. Wings were\ngiven me, and an angel attended me from the city to a place that was\nbright and glorious. The grass of the place was living green, and the\nbirds there warbled a sweet song. The inhabitants of the place were\nof all sizes; they were noble, majestic, and lovely. They bore the\nexpress image of Jesus, and their countenances beamed with holy\njoy, expressive of the freedom and happiness of the place.\nI asked one of them why they were so much more lovely than\nthose on the earth. The reply was, “We have lived in strict obedience\nto the commandments of God, and have not fallen by disobedience,\nlike those on the earth.” Then I saw two trees, one looked much like\nthe tree of life in the city.

Then my attending angel said to me, “None\nin this place have tasted of the forbidden tree; but if they should eat,\nthey would fall.”\nThen I was taken to a world which had seven moons. There I\nsaw good old Enoch, who had been translated.... I asked him if this\nwas the place he was taken to from the earth. He said, “It is not;\nthe city is my home, and I have come to visit this place.” He moved\nabout the place as if perfectly at home.\nI begged of my attending angel to let me remain in that place.

It is\npresumption to indulge in suppositions and theories regarding mat-\nters that God has not made known to us in His word. We need not\nenter into speculation regarding our future state....\n“Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season.” Do not\nbring to the foundation wood, and hay, and stubble—your own\nsurmisings and speculations, which can benefit no one.\nChrist withheld no truths essential to our salvation.

Over the scene the morning stars will\nsing together, and the sons of God will shout for joy....\n“And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another,\nand from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship\nbefore me, saith the Lord.” The glory of the Lord shall be revealed,\nand all flesh shall see it together.” “The Lord God will cause righ-\nteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.” “In that\nday shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem\nof beauty, unto the residue of his people.”\nSo long as the heavens and the earth endure, the Sabbath will\ncontinue as a sign of the Creator’s power. And when Eden shall\n752\nSabbathintheHereafter,December29 753\nbloom on earth again, God’s holy rest day will be honored by all\nbeneath the sun. “From one sabbath to another” the inhabitants of\nthe glorified new earth shall go up “to worship before me, saith the\nLord.” Isaiah 66:23."

Zechariah 14:9.\nThe great plan of redemption results in fully bringing back the\nworld into God’s favor. All that was lost by sin is restored. Not\nonly man but the earth is redeemed, to be the eternal abode of the\nobedient. For six thousand years Satan has struggled to maintain\npossession of the earth. Now God’s original purpose in its creation is\naccomplished. “The saints of the most High shall take the kingdom,\nand possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever” (Daniel\n7:18).\n“From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same\nthe Lord’s name is to be praised” (Psalm 113:3). “In that day shall\nthere be one Lord, and his name one.” “And the Lord shall be king\nover all the earth” (Zechariah 14:9).... “All His commandments are\nsure. They stand fast for ever and ever” (Psalm 111:7, 8). The sacred\nstatutes whichSatan has hatedandsoughtto destroy, willbe honored\nthroughout a sinless universe.\nThrough Christ’s redeeming work the government of God stands\njustified. The Omnipotent One is made known as the God of love.\nSatan’schargesarerefuted,andhischaracterunveiled. Rebellioncan\nnever again arise. Sin can never again enter the universe. Through\neternal ages all are secure from apostasy. By love’s self-sacrifice, the\ninhabitants of earth and heaven are bound to their Creator in bonds\nof indissoluble union....\nIn the place where sin abounded, God’s grace much more\nabounds. The earth itself, the very field that Satan claims as his, is to\nbe not only ransomed but exalted. Our little world, under the curse\nof sin the one dark blot in His glorious creation, will be honored\nabove all other worlds in the universe of God. Here, where the Son\nof God tabernacled in humanity; where the King of glory lived and\nsuffered and died—here, when He shall make all things new, the\n754\nEternalSecurity,December30 755\ntabernacle of God shall be with men, “and he will dwell with them,\nand they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them,\nand be their God.” And through endless ages as the redeemed walk\nin the light of the Lord, they will praise Him for His unspeakable\nGift—Immanuel, “God with us.”;\n[373] What Eternity Holds for the Redeemed, December\n31\nWith long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.\nPsalm 91:16.\nAll the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of\nGod’s redeemed. Unfettered by mortality, they wing their tireless\nflighttoworldsafar—worldsthatthrilledwithsorrowatthespectacle\nof human woe and rang with songs of gladness at the tidings of a\nransomed soul. With unutterable delight the children of earth enter\ninto the joy and the wisdom of unfallen beings. They share the\ntreasures of knowledge and understanding gained through ages upon\nages in contemplation of God’s handiwork. With undimmed vision\nthey gaze upon the glory of creation—suns and stars and systems,\nall in their appointed order circling the throne of Deity. Upon all\nthings, from the least to the greatest, the Creator’s name is written,\nand in all are the riches of His power displayed.\nAnd the years of eternity, as they roll, will bring richer and still\nmore glorious revelations of God and of Christ. As knowledge is\nprogressive, so will love, reverence, and happiness increase. The\nmore men learn of God, the greater will be their admiration of His\ncharacter. As Jesus opens before them the riches of redemption and\nthe amazing achievements in the great controversy with Satan, the\nhearts of the ransomed thrill with more fervent devotion, and with\nmore rapturous joy they sweep the harps of gold; and ten thousand\ntimes ten thousand and thousands of thousands of voices unite to\nswell the mighty chorus of praise.\n“And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and\nunder the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them,\nheard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto\nhim that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and\never.” Revelation 5:13.\n756\nWhatEternityHoldsfortheRedeemed,December31 757\nThe great controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no more.\nThe entire universe is clean. One pulse of harmony and gladness\nbeats through the vast creation. From Him who created all, flow life\nand light and gladness, throughout the realms of illimitable space.\nFrom the minutest atom to the greatest world, all things, animate\nand inanimate, in their unshadowed beauty and perfect joy, declare\nthat God is love."
