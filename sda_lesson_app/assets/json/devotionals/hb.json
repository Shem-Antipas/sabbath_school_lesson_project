Though unable to controvert\nthe plain teachings of Scripture, they yet manifest the utmost reluc-\ntance to study the evidences offered.

He came to\nthe world to display the glory of God, that we might be uplifted\nby its restoring power. God was manifested in Him that He might\nbe manifested in us. Jesus revealed no qualities, and exercised no\npowers, that we may not have through faith in Him. His perfect\nhumanity is that which all His followers may possess, if they will be\nin subjection to God as He was.\n“And greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto My\nFather.” (Verse 12.) By this Christ did not mean that the disciples’\nworkwouldbe ofa more exaltedcharacterthan His, butthatitwould\nhave greater extent. He did not refer merely to miracle working, but\nto all that would take place under the working of the Holy Spirit.\nAfter the Lord’s ascension, the disciples realized the fulfillment\nof His promise. The scenes of the crucifixion, resurrection, and\nascension of Christ were a living reality to them. They saw that the\nprophecies had been literally fulfilled. They searched the Scriptures,\nand accepted their teaching with a faith and assurance unknown\nbefore. They knew that the divine Teacher was all that He had\nGreaterWorks,February3 87\nclaimed to be. As they told their experience, and exalted the love of\nGod, hearts were melted and subdued, and multitudes believed on\nJesus.\nThe Saviour’s promise to His disciples is a promise to His church\nto the end of time. God did not design that His wonderful plan to\nredeem humanity should achieve only insignificant results. All who\nwill go to work, trusting not in what they themselves can do, but\nin what God can do for and through them, will certainly realize the\nfulfillment of His promise. “Greater works than these shall ye do,”\nHe declares; “because I go unto My Father.”—The Desire of Ages,\n664, 667."

We need a power outside of and beyond ourselves, to restore\nus to the likeness of God, and enable us to do the work of God;\nbut this does not make the human agency unessential. Humanity\nlays hold upon divine power, Christ dwells in the heart by faith; and\nthrough cooperation with the divine, human power becomes efficient\nfor good.\nHe who called the fisherman of Galilee is still calling followers\nto His service. And He is just as willing to manifest His power\nthrough us as through the first disciples.

This is why the preaching of the gospel was\ncommitted to erring mortals rather than to the angels. It is manifest\nthat the power which works through the weakness of humanity is\nthe power of God; and thus we are encouraged to believe that the\npower which can help others as weak as ourselves can help us.

In constantly beholding Him, we “are changed\ninto the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the\nLord.” (2 Corinthians 3:18.)\nIt was thus that the early disciples gained their likeness to the\ndear Saviour. When those disciples heard the words of Jesus, they\nfelt their need of Him. They sought, they found, they followed\nHim. They were with Him in the house, at the table, in the closet,\nin the field. They were with Him as pupils with a teacher, daily\nreceiving from His lips lessons of holy truth. They looked to Him,\nas servants to their master, to learn their duty. Those disciples were\nmen “subject to like passions as we are.” (James 5:17.) They had the\nsame battle with sin to fight.

The Holy Spirit describes\nour condition in such words as these: “Dead in trespasses and sins;”\n“the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint;” “no soundness\nin it.” We are held fast in the snare of Satan, “taken captive by\nhim at his will.” (Ephesians 2:1; Isaiah 1:5, 6; 2 Timothy 2:26.)\nGod desires to heal us, to set us free. But since this requires an\nentire transformation, a renewing of our whole nature, we must yield\nourselves wholly to Him.\nThewarfareagainstselfisthegreatestbattlethatwaseverfought.\nThe yielding of self, surrendering all to the will of God, requires a\nstruggle; but the soul must submit to God before it can be renewed\nin holiness.\nThe government of God is not, as Satan would make it appear,\nfounded upon a blind submission, an unreasoning control. It appeals\nto the intellect and the conscience. “Come now, and let us reason\ntogether” is the Creator’s invitation to the beings He has made.\n(Isaiah 1:18.) God does not force the will of His creatures. He\ncannot accept an homage that is not willingly and intelligently given.\nA mere forced submission would prevent all real development of\nmind or character; it would make us mere automatons. Such is\nnot the purpose of the Creator. He desires that human beings, the\ncrowningworkofHiscreativepower, shallreachthehighestpossible\ndevelopment. He sets before us the height of blessing to which He\ndesires to bring us through His grace. He invites us to give ourselves\nto Him, that He may work His will in us. It remains for us to choose\nwhether we will be set free from the bondage of sin, to share the\nglorious liberty of the sons of God.\nIn giving ourselves to God, we must necessarily give up all that\nwould separate us from Him. Hence the Saviour says, “Whosoever\nhe be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be My\ndisciple.” (Luke 14:33.) Whatever shall draw away the heart from\nA profession of Christ without this deep love is mere talk, dry\nformality, and heavy drudgery.—Steps to Christ, 43, 44."

It is often\nthe case that trouble is greater in anticipation than in reality; but\nthis is not true of the crisis before us. The most vivid presentation\ncannot reach the magnitude of the ordeal. In that time of trial, every\nsoul must stand individually before God. “Though Noah, Daniel,\nand Job” were in the land, “as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall\ndeliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own\nsouls by their righteousness.” (Ezekiel 14:20.)\nNow, while our great High Priest is making the atonement for us,\nwe should seek to become perfect in Christ.

It is conformity to the law of God, for “all Thy com-\nmandments are righteousness” (Psalm 119:172), and “love is the\nfulfilling of the law.” (Romans 13:10.)

Then, as witnesses for the Saviour, they may make known\nwhat divine grace has done for them.\nTrue sanctification comes through the working out of the princi-\nple of love. “God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in\nGod, and God in him.” (1 John 4:16.) The lives of those in whose\nhearts Christ abides, will reveal practical godliness. The character\nwill be purified, elevated, ennobled, and glorified.

It is not gained by a happy flight of feeling, but is the\nresult of constantly dying to sin, and constantly living for Christ.\nWrongs cannot be righted nor reformations wrought in the character\nby feeble, intermittent efforts.

And Paul teaches that believers\nare to be “sanctified by the Holy Ghost.” (Romans 15:16.) What\nis the work of the Holy Spirit? Jesus told His disciples: “When\nHe, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth.”\n(John 16:13.) And the psalmist says: “Thy law is the truth.” By the\nword and the Spirit of God are opened to us the great principles of\nrighteousness embodied in His law. And since the law of God is\n“holy, and just, and good,” a transcript of the divine perfection, it\nfollows that a character formed by obedience to that law will be holy.\nChrist is a perfect example of such a character. He says: “I have kept\nMy Father’s commandments.” “I do always those things that please\nHim.” (John 15:10; 8:29.) The followers of Christ are to become\nlike Him—by the grace of God to form characters in harmony with\nthe principles of His holy law. This is Bible sanctification.\nThis work can be accomplished only through faith in Christ,\nby the power of the indwelling Spirit of God. Paul admonishes\nbelievers: “Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.\nForitis Godwhichworkethin you bothto willandto do ofHis good"

Multitudes sorrow that they have sinned and even make an\noutward reformation because they fear that their wrongdoing will\nbring suffering upon themselves. But this is not repentance in the\nBible sense. They lament the suffering rather than the sin. Such\nwas the grief of Esau when he saw that the birthright was lost to\nhim forever. Balaam, terrified by the angel standing in his pathway\nwith drawn sword, acknowledged his guilt lest he should lose his\nlife; but there was no genuine repentance for sin, no conversion of\npurpose, no abhorrence of evil. Judas Iscariot, after betraying his\nLord, exclaimed, “I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent\nblood.” (Matthew 27:4.)\nThe confession was forcedfrom his guilty soulby an awfulsense\nof condemnation and a fearful looking for of judgment. The conse-\nquences that were to result to him filled him with terror, but there\nwas no deep, heartbreaking grief in his soul, that he had betrayed\nthe spotless Son of God and denied the Holy One of Israel. Pharaoh,\nwhen suffering under the judgments of God, acknowledged his sin\nin order to escape further punishment, but returned to his defiance of\nHeaven as soon as the plagues were stayed. These all lamented the\nresults of sin, but did not sorrow for the sin itself.—Steps to Christ,\n23, 24."

Day by\nday, in contrast with his own violent spirit, he beheld the tenderness\nand forbearance of Jesus, and heard His lessons of humility and\npatience. Day by day his heart was drawn out to Christ, until he\nlost sight of self in love for his Master. The power and tenderness,\nthe majesty and meekness, the strength and patience, that he saw\nin the daily life of the Son of God, filled his soul with admiration.\nHe yielded his resentful, ambitious temper to the molding power of\nChrist, and divine love wrought in him a transformation of character.\nSuch transformation of character as is seen in the life of John\nis ever the result of communion with Christ. There may be marked\ndefects in people’s characters, yet when they become true disciples\nof Christ, the power of divine grace transforms and sanctifies them.\nBeholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, they are changed from\nglory to glory, until they are like Him whom they adore.\nJohn was a teacher of holiness, and in his letters to the church\nhe laid down unerring rules for the conduct of Christians. “Every\nman that hath this hope in him,” he wrote, “purifieth himself, even\nas He is pure.” “He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also\nso to walk, even as He walked.” (1 John 3:3; 2:6.)

You are in danger of making a world of an\natom, and an atom of a world.\nAs penitent sinners, contrite before God, discern Christ’s atone-\nment in their behalf, and accept this atonement as their only hope\nin this life and the future life, their sins are pardoned. This is jus-\ntification by faith. Every believing soul is to conform his or her\nwill entirely to God’s will, and keep in a state of repentance and\ncontrition, exercising faith in the atoning merits of the Redeemer,\nand advancing from strength to strength, from glory to glory.\nJustification is the opposite of condemnation. God’s boundless\nmercy is exercised toward those who are wholly undeserving. He\nforgives transgressions and sins for the sake of Jesus, who has be-\ncome the propitiation for our sins. Through faith in Christ the guilty\ntransgressor is brought into favor with God and into the strong hope\nof life eternal.\nDavid was pardoned of his transgression because he humbled his\nheart before God in repentance and contrition of soul and believed\nthat God’s promise to forgive would be fulfilled. He confessed his\nsin, repented, and was reconverted. In the rapture of the assurance\nof forgiveness he exclaimed, “Blessed is he whose transgression is\nforgiven, whose sin is covered.

Christ calls upon those\nwho stand under His banner to engage in the conflict with Him as\nfaithful soldiers, that they may inherit the crown of life.

But these are not\nenough; we need also to pour out our hearts to Him. In order to have\nspiritual life and energy, we must have actual communication with\nour heavenly Father. Our minds may be drawn out toward Him; we\nmay meditate upon His works, His mercies, His blessings; but this is\nnot, in the fullest sense, communing with Him. In order to commune\nwith God, we must have something to say to Him concerning our\nactual life.\nPrayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. Not that\nit is necessary in order to make known to God what we are, but in\norder to enable us to receive Him. Prayer does not bring God down\nto us, but brings us up to Him.\nWhen Jesus was upon the earth, He taught His disciples how to\npray. He directed them to present their daily needs before God, and\nto cast all their care upon Him. And the assurance He gave them\nthat their petitions should be heard, is assurance also to us.\nJesus Himself, while He dwelt among humanity, was often in\nprayer. OurSaviour identified Himself with our needs and weakness,\nin that He became a suppliant, a petitioner, seeking from His Father\nfresh supplies of strength, that He might come forth braced for duty\nand trial. He is our example in all things. He is a brother in our\ninfirmities, “in all points tempted like as we are;” but as the sinless\none His nature recoiled from evil; He endured struggles and torture\nof soul in a world of sin. His humanity made prayer a necessity\nand a privilege. He found comfort and joy in communion with His\nFather. And if the Saviour, the Son of God, felt the need of prayer,\nhow much more should feeble, sinful mortals feel the necessity of\nfervent, constant prayer.\nWhatDoYouTalkToGodAbout?,May1 269\nOur heavenly Father waits to bestow upon us the fullness of\nHis blessing.

Why should\nthe sons and daughters of God be reluctant to pray, when prayer is\nthe key in the hand of faith to unlock heaven’s storehouse, where\nare treasured the boundless resources of Omnipotence? Without\nunceasing prayer and diligent watching we are in danger of growing\ncareless and of deviating from the right path. The adversary seeks\ncontinually to obstruct the way to the mercy seat, that we may not\nby earnest supplication and faith obtain grace and power to resist\ntemptation.\nThere are certain conditions upon which we may expect that God\nwill hear and answer our prayers. One of the first of these is that we\nfeel our need of help from Him. He has promised, “I will pour water\nupon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground.” (Isaiah\n44:3.) Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, who long\nafter God, may be sure that they will be filled. The heart must be\nopen to the Spirit’s influence, or God’s blessing cannot be received.\nOur great need is itself an argument and pleads most eloquently\nin our behalf. But the Lord is to be sought unto to do these things for\nus. He says, “Ask, and it shall be given you.” And “He that spared\nnot His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not\nwith Him also freely give us all things?” (Matthew 7:7; Romans\n8:32.)\nKeyInTheHandofFaith,May2 271\nIf we regard iniquity in our hearts, if we cling to any known sin,\nthe Lord will not hear us; but the prayer of the penitent, contrite soul\nis always accepted.

        "verse_ref": "",
        "content": "Pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks.—1\nThessalonians 5:17, 18.\nChrist’s lessons in regard to prayer should be carefully consid-\nered. There is a divine science in prayer, and His illustration [of the\nfriend at midnight, Luke 11:5-8] brings to view principles that all\nneed to understand. He shows what is the true spirit of prayer, He\nteaches the necessity of perseverance in presenting our requests to\nGod, and assures us of His willingness to hear and answer prayer.\nOur prayers are not to be a selfish asking, merely for our own\nbenefit. We are to ask that we may give. The principle of Christ’s\nlife must be the principle of our lives. “For their sakes,” He said,\nspeaking of His disciples, “I sanctify Myself, that they also might be\nsanctified.” (John 17:19.) The same devotion, the same self-sacrifice,\nthe same subjection to the claims of the word of God, that were\nmanifest in Christ, must be seen in His servants. Our mission to\nthe world is not to serve or please ourselves; we are to glorify God\nby cooperating with Him to save sinners. We are to ask blessings\nfrom God that we may communicate to others. The capacity for\nreceiving is preserved only by imparting. We cannot continue to\nreceive heavenly treasure without communicating to those around\nus.\nIn the parable the petitioner was again and again repulsed, but he\ndid not relinquish his purpose. So our prayers do not always seem to\nreceive an immediate answer; but Christ teaches that we should not\ncease to pray. Prayer is not to work any change in God; it is to bring\nus into harmony with God. When we make request of Him, He may\nsee that it is necessary for us to search our hearts and repent of sin.\nTherefore He takes us through test and trial, He brings us through\nhumiliation, that we may see what hinders the working of His Holy\nSpirit through us.\nScienceofPrayer,May3 273\nThere are conditions to the fulfillment of God’s promises, and\nprayer can never take the place of duty. “If ye love Me,” Christ says,\n“Keep My command-ments.” “He that hath My commandments,\nand keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me; and he that loveth Me\nshall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest\nMyself to him.” (John 14:15, 21.) Those who bring their petitions\nto God, claiming His promise while they do not comply with the\nconditions, insult Jehovah. They bring the name of Christ as their\nauthority for the fulfillment of the promise, but they do not those\nthings that would show faith in Christ and love for Him.—Christ’s\nObject Lessons, 142, 143."

Jesus said to His disciples,\n“What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive\nthem, and ye shall have them.” (Mark 11:24.) Do we take Him at\nHis word?\nThe assurance is broad and unlimited, and He is faithful who has\npromised. When we do not receive the very things we asked for, at\nthe time we ask, we are still to believe that the Lord hears and that\nHe will answer our prayers. We are so erring and short-sighted that\nwe sometimes ask for things that would not be a blessing to us, and\nour heavenly Father in love answers our prayers by giving us that\nwhich will be for our highest good—that which we ourselves would\ndesire if with vision divinely enlightened we could see all things as\nthey really are. When ourprayers seem notto be answered, we are to\ncling to the promise; for the time of answering will surely come, and\nwe shall receive the blessing we need most. But to claim that prayer\nwill always be answered in the very way and for the particular thing\nthat we desire, is presumption. God is too wise to err, and too good\nto withhold any good thing from them that walk uprightly. Then\ndo not fear to trust Him, even though you do not see the immediate\nanswer to your prayers. Rely upon His sure promise, “Ask, and it\nshall be given you.”\nIf we take counsel with our doubts and fears, or try to solve\neverything that we cannot see clearly, before we have faith, perplex-\nities will only increase and deepen. But if we come to God, feeling\nhelpless and dependent, as we really are, and in humble, trusting\nfaith make known our wants to Him whose knowledge is infinite,\nwho sees everything in creation, and who governs everything by His\nAnotherCondition,May4 275\nwill and word, He can and will attend to our cry, and will let light\nshine into our hearts. Through sincere prayer we are brought into\nconnection with the mind of the Infinite. We may have no remark-\nable evidence at the time that the face of our Redeemer is bending\nover us in compassion and love, but this is even so. We may not\nfeel His visible touch, but His hand is upon us in love and pitying\ntenderness.\nWhen we come to ask mercy and blessing from God we should\nhave a spirit of love and forgiveness in our own hearts.—Steps to\nChrist, 96, 97."

How appropriate it is for parents to gather their\nchildren about them before the fast is broken, to thank the heavenly\nFather for His protection during the night, and to ask Him for His\nhelp and guidance and watch care during the day!

You\nare not to pray occasionally and, when you have a large day’s work\nto do, neglect it. In thus doing you lead your children to look upon\nprayer as of no special consequence. Prayer means very much to the\nchildren of God, and thank offerings should come up before God\nmorning and evening. Says the psalmist, “O come, let us sing unto\nthe Lord: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. Let\nus come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful\nnoise unto him with psalms.” (Psalm 95:1, 2.)\nFathers and mothers, however pressing your business, do not fail\nto gather your family around God’s altar.

Satan, working through\nunconsecrated leaders of the church, tampered with the fourth com-\nmandment also, and essayed [tried] to set aside the ancient Sabbath,\nthe day which God had blessed and sanctified (Genesis 2:2, 3), and\nin its stead to exalt the festival observed by the heathen as “the ven-\nerable day of the sun.” This change was not at first attempted openly.\nIn the first centuries the true Sabbath had been kept by all Christians.\nThey were jealous for the honor of God, and, believing that His law\nis immutable, they zealously guarded the sacredness of its precepts.\nBut with great subtlety Satan worked through his agents to bring\nabout his object. That the attention of the people might be called\nto the Sunday, it was made a festival in honor of the resurrection of\nChrist. Religious services were held upon it; yet it was regarded as\na day of recreation, the Sabbath being still sacredly observed.\nTo prepare the way for the work which he designed to accom-\nplish, Satan had led the Jews, before the advent of Christ, to load\ndown the Sabbath with the most rigorous exactions, making its ob-\nservance a burden. Now, taking advantage of the false light in which\nhe had thus caused it to be regarded, he cast contempt upon it as a\nJewish institution. While Christians generally continued to observe\nthe Sunday as a joyous festival, he led them, in order to show their\nhatred of Judaism, to make the Sabbath a fast, a day of sadness and\nThe archdeceiver had not completed his work.

Vast councils were held from time to time, in which\nSatan’sAttackOnTheSabbath,June26 383\nthe dignitaries of the church were convened from all the world.\nIn nearly every council the Sabbath which God had instituted was\npressed down a little lower, while the Sunday was correspondingly\nexalted.

Should their probation close suddenly,\nthey would not leave such great perplexity upon those who are called\nto settle their estate.\nMany are not exercised upon the subject of making their wills\nwhile they are in apparent health. But this precaution should be\ntaken. They should know their financial standing and should not\nallow their business to become entangled.

Af-\nter they are drawn, they may remain for years and do no harm, if\ndonations continue to be made from time to time as the cause has\nneed. Death will not come one day sooner, brethren, because you\nhave made your will. In disposing of your property by will to your\nrelatives, be sure that you do not forget God’s cause. You are His\nagents, holding His property; and His claims should have your first\nconsideration. Your wife and children, of course, should not be left\ndestitute; provision should be made for them if they are needy. But\ndo not, simply because it is customary, bring into your will a long\nline of relatives who are not needy.\nLet no one think that it will meet the mind of Christ to hoard up\nproperty through life and then at death make a bequest of a portion\nof it to some benevolent cause.\nSome selfishly retain their means during their lifetime, trusting\nto make up for their neglect by remembering the cause in their wills.\nBut not half the means thus bestowed in legacies ever benefits the\nobject specified. Brethren and sisters, invest in the bank of heaven\nyourselves, and do not leave your stewardship upon another.\nRememberGodInYourWill,July6 405\nParents should have great fear in entrusting children with the\ntalents of means that God has placed in their hands, unless they\nhave the surest evidence that their children have greater interest in,\nlove for, and devotion to the cause of God than they themselves\npossess, and that these children will be more earnest and zealous in\nforwarding the work of God.—The Adventist Home, 396-398."

The history of Joseph and Daniel is an illustration\nof what He will do for those who yield themselves to Him and with\nthe whole heart seek to accomplish His purpose.\nThe greatest want of the world is the want of those men and\nwomen who will not be bought or sold, those who in their inmost\nsouls are true and honest, those who do not fear to call sin by its\nright name, those whose conscience is as true to duty as the needle\nto the pole, those who will stand for the right though the heavens\nfall.\nBut such a character is not the result of accident; it is not due\nto special favors or endowments of Providence. A noble character\nis the result of self-discipline, of the subjection of the lower to the\nhigher nature—the surrender of self for the service of love to God\nand to others.\nThe youth need to be impressed with the truth that their en-\ndowments are not their own. Strength, time, intellect, are but lent\ntreasures. They belong to God, and it should be the resolve of ev-\nery youth to put them to the highest use. The youth are branches,\nfrom which God expects fruit; stewards, whose capital must yield\nincrease; lights, to illuminate the world’s darkness.\nEvery youth, every child, has a work to do for the honor of God\nand the uplifting of humanity.\nThe early years of the prophet Elisha were passed in the qui-\netude of country life, under the teaching of God and nature and the\ndiscipline of useful work.

I long to see them helping one another\nto reach a higher plane of Christian experience.\nChrist came to teach the human family the way of salvation,\nand He made this way so plain that a little child can walk in it.

If the youth would\nbut make the Bible their study, would but calm their impetuous de-\nsires, and listen to the voice of their Creator and Redeemer, they\nwould not only be at peace with God, but would find themselves\nennobled and elevated. It will be for your eternal interest, my young\nfriend, to give heed to the instructions in the word of God, for they\nare of inestimable importance to you.\nI entreat you to be wise, and consider what will be the result\nof leading a wild life, uncontrolled by the Spirit of God. “Be not\ndeceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that\nshall he also reap.

If you begin to go in a wrong direction, every step\nwill be fraught with peril and disaster, and you will go on straying\nfrom the path of truth, safety, and success.

This is the only effectual teacher of divine\ntruth. Only when the truth is accompanied to the heart by the Spirit\nwill it quicken the conscience or transform the life. We might be\nable to present the letter of the word of God, we might be familiar\nwith all its commands and promises; but unless the Holy Spirit sets\nhome the truth, no souls will fall on the Rock and be broken. No\namount of education, no advantages, however great, can make one a\nchannel of light without the cooperation of the Spirit of God. The\nsowing of the gospel seed will not be a success unless the seed is\nquickened into life by the dew of heaven. Before one book of the\nNew Testament was written, before one gospel sermon had been\npreached after Christ’s ascension, the Holy Spirit came upon the\npraying apostles. Then the testimony of their enemies was, “Ye have\nfilled Jerusalem with your doctrine.” (Acts 5:28.)\nChrist has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church,\nand the promise belongs to us as much as to the first disciples. But\nlike every other promise, it is given on conditions. There are many\nwho believe and profess to claim the Lord’s promise; they talk about\nChrist and about the Holy Spirit, yet receive no benefit. They do not\nsurrenderthe soulto be guidedandcontrolledby the divine agencies.\nWe cannot use the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is to use us. Through\nthe Spirit God works in His people “to will and to do of His good\npleasure.” (Philippians 2:13.) But many will not submit to this. They\nwant to manage themselves. This is why they do not receive the\nheavenly gift. Only to those who wait humbly upon God, who watch\nfor His guidance and grace, is the Spirit given. The power of God\nPowerInTheChurch,August9 475\nawaits their demand and reception. This promised blessing, claimed\nby faith, brings all other blessings in its train. It is given according\nto the riches of the grace of Christ, and He is ready to supply every\nsoul according to the capacity to receive.\nIn His discourse to the disciples, Jesus made no mournful allu-\nsion to His own sufferings and death. His last legacy to them was a\nlegacy of peace. He said, “Peace I leave with you, My peace I give\nunto you.” (John 14:27.)—The Desire of Ages, 671, 672."

        "content": "The kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the\nsea, and gathered of every kind; which, when it was full, they drew\nto shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast\nthe bad away. So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall\ncome forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, and shall cast\nthem into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of\nteeth.”\nThe casting ofthe netis the preaching ofthe gospel. This gathers\nboth good and evil into the church. When the mission of the gospel\nis completed, the judgment will accomplish the work of separation.\nChrist saw how the existence of false members in the church would\ncause the way of truth to be evil spoken of. The world would revile\nthe gospel because of the inconsistent lives of false professors. Even\nChristians would be caused to stumble as they saw that many who\nbore Christ’s name were not controlled by His Spirit. Because these\nsinners were in the church, many would be in danger of thinking\nthat God excused their sins. Therefore Christ lifts the veil from the\nfuture and bids all to behold that it is character, not position, which\ndecides a person’s destiny.\nBoth the parable of the tares and that of the net plainly teach that\nthere is no time when all the wicked will turn to God. The wheat\nand the tares grow together until the harvest. The good and the bad\nfish are together drawn ashore for a final separation.\nAgain, these parables teach that there is to be no probation after\nthe judgment. When the work of the gospel is completed, there\nimmediately follows the separation between the good and the evil,\nand the destiny of each class is forever fixed.\nGod does not desire the destruction of any. “As I live, saith the\nLord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that\nGospelNet,August20 497\nthe wicked turn from his way and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your\nevil ways; for why will ye die?” (Ezekiel 33:11.) Throughout the\nperiod of probationary time His Spirit is entreating men and women\nto accept the gift of life. It is only those who reject His pleading that\nwill be left to perish. God has declared that sin must be destroyed as\nan evil ruinous to the universe. Those who cling to sin will perish in\nits destruction.—Christ’s Object Lessons, 122, 123."

Where this oneness exists, it is\nevidence that the image of God is being restored in humanity, that\na new principle of life has been implanted. It shows that there is\npower in the divine nature to withstand the supernatural agencies of\nevil, and that the grace of God subdues the selfishness inherent in\nthe natural heart.\nThis love, manifested in the church, will surely stir the wrath of\nSatan. Christ did not mark out for His disciples an easy path. “If\nthe world hate you,” He said, “ye know that it hated Me before it\nhated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own:\nbut because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the\nworld, therefore the world hateth you.

Again and again Paul warned the believers\nagainst these false teachers. This peril, above all others, they must\nguard against; for by receiving false teachers, they would open the\ndoor to errors by which the enemy would dim the spiritual percep-\ntions and shake the confidence of those newly come to the faith of\nthe gospel.

To\nmany the Bible is as a lamp without oil, because they have turned\ntheir minds into channels of speculative belief that bring misunder-\nstanding and confusion. The work of higher criticism, in dissecting,\nconjecturing, reconstructing, is destroying faith in the Bible as a di-\nvine revelation.

In whom-\nsoever they may appear, vulgarity of language and of demeanor\nindicate a vitiated heart. Truth of heavenly origin never degrades the\nreceiver, never makes a person coarse or rough. Truth is softening\nand refining in its influence. When received into the heart, it makes\nthe youth respectful and polite. Christian politeness is received\nonly under the working of the Holy Spirit. It does not consist in\naffectation or artificial polish, in bowing and simpering. This is the\nclass of politeness possessed by those of the world, but they are\ndestitute of true Christian politeness. True polish, true politeness,\nis obtained only from a practical knowledge of the gospel of Christ.\nTrue politeness, true courtesy, is a kindness shown to all, high or\nlow, rich or poor.\nThe essence of true politeness is consideration for others. The\nessential, enduring education is that which broadens the sympathies\nand encourages universal kindliness.

The people gave credence to what the priests and Phar-\nisees taught, in place of seeking to understand the word of God for\nthemselves. They honored the priests and rulers instead of honoring\nGod, and rejected the truth that they might keep their own traditions.\nMany had been impressed and almost persuaded; but they did not\nact upon their convictions, and were not reckoned on the side of\nChrist. Satan presented his temptations, until the light appeared as\ndarkness. Thus many rejected the truth that would have proved the\nsaving of the soul.\nThe True Witness says, “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock.”\n(Revelation 3:20.) Every warning, reproof, and entreaty in the word\nof God or through His messengers is a knock at the door of the\nheart. It is the voice of Jesus asking for entrance. With every\nknock unheeded, the disposition to open becomes weaker. The\nimpressions of the Holy Spirit if disregarded today, will not be as\nstrong tomorrow. The heart becomes less impressible, and lapses\ninto a perilous unconsciousness of the shortness of life, and of the\ngreat eternity beyond. Our condemnation in the judgment will not\nresult from the fact that we have been in error, but from the fact that\nwe have neglected heaven-sent opportunities for learning what is\ntruth.\nLike the apostles, the seventy [see Luke 10:1] had received\nsupernatural endowments as a seal of their mission. When their\nwork was completed, they returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even\nthe devils are subject unto us through Thy name.” Jesus answered,\n“I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.” The scenes of the\npast and the future were presented to the mind of Jesus. He beheld\nSatanFellLikeLightning,October25 633\nLucifer as he was first cast out from the heavenly places. He looked\nforward to the scenes of His own agony, when before all the worlds\nBeyond the cross of Calvary, with its agony and shame, Jesus\nlooked forward to the great final day, when the prince of the power\nof the air will meet his destruction in the earth so long marred by his\nrebellion.

They see the work of evil, with\nits terrible results of woe and desolation, and they question how\nall this can exist under the sovereignty of One who is infinite in\nwisdom, in power, and in love. Here is a mystery of which they\nfind no explanation. And in their uncertainty and doubt they are\nblinded to truths plainly revealed in God’s word and essential to\nsalvation. There are those who, in their inquiries concerning the\nexistence of sin, endeavor to search into that which God has never\nrevealed; hence they find no solution of their difficulties; and such\nas are actuated by a disposition to doubt and cavil seize upon this\nas an excuse for rejecting the words of Holy Writ. Others, however,\nfail of a satisfactory understanding of the great problem of evil,\nfrom the fact that tradition and misinterpretation have obscured the\nteaching of the Bible concerning the character of God, the nature of\nHis government, and the principles of His dealing with sin.\nIt is impossible to explain the origin of sin so as to give a reason\nfor its existence. Yet enough may be understood concerning both\nthe origin and the final disposition of sin to make fully manifest\nthe justice and benevolence of God in all His dealings with evil.\nNothing is more plainly taught in Scripture than that God was in no\nwise responsible for the entrance of sin; that there was no arbitrary\nwithdrawal of divine grace, no deficiency in the divine government,\nthat gave occasion for the uprising of rebellion. Sin is an intruder,\nfor whose presence no reason can be given. It is mysterious, unac-\ncountable; to excuse it is to defend it. Could excuse for it be found,\nor cause be shown for its existence, it would cease to be sin. Our\nonly definition of sin is that given in the word of God; it is “the\nOriginofSinIsUnexplainable,November1 649\ntransgression of the law;” it is the outworking of a principle at war\nwith the great law of love which is the foundation of the divine\nGod desires from all His creatures the service of love—homage\nthat springs from an intelligent appreciation of His character.

Thou wast perfect in thy ways\nfrom the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.”\n(Ezekiel 28:12-15.)\nLucifer might have remained in favor with God, beloved and\nhonored by all the angelic host, exercising his noble powers to bless\nothers and to glorify his Maker. But, says the prophet, “Thine heart\nwas lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom\nby reason ofthy brightness.” (Verse 17.) Little by little, Lucifercame\nmake God supreme in the affections and allegiance of His creatures,\nit was Lucifer’s endeavor to win their service and homage to himself.\nAnd coveting the honor which the infinite Father had bestowed upon\nHis Son, this prince of angels aspired to power which it was the\nprerogative of Christ alone to wield.\nAll heaven had rejoiced to reflect the Creator’s glory and to\nshow forth His praise. And while God was thus honored, all had\nbeen peace and gladness. But a note of discord now marred the\ncelestial harmonies.

It was not so much because He appeared without worldly\nwealth, pomp, orgrandeurthattheJewswereledtorejectHim. They\nsaw that He possessed power which would more than compensate\nfor the lack of these outward advantages. But the purity and holiness\nof Christ called forth against Him the hatred of the ungodly. His\nlife of self-denial and sinless devotion was a perpetual reproof to a\nproud, sensual people. It was this that evoked enmity against the Son\nof God. Satan and evil angels joined with evil human beings. All\nthe energies of apostasy conspired against the Champion of truth.\nThe same enmity is manifested toward Christ’s followers as\nwas manifested toward their Master. Whoever sees the repulsive\ncharacter of sin, and in strength from above resists temptation, will\nassuredly arouse the wrath of Satan and his subjects. Hatred of\nthe pure principles of truth, and reproach and persecution of its\nadvocates, willexistas long as sin andsinners remain.

It was not for this alone that Christ\ncame to the earth; it was not merely that the inhabitants of this little\nworld might regard the law of God as it should be regarded; but it\nwas to vindicate the character of God before the universe. To this\nresult of His great sacrifice—its influence upon the intelligences\nof other worlds, as well as upon man—the Saviour looked forward\nwhen just before His crucifixion He said: “Now is the judgment of\nthis world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if\nI be lifted up from the earth, will draw all unto Me.” (John 12:31,\n32.) The act of Christ in dying for the salvation of mankind would\nnot only make heaven accessible to men and women, but before all\nthe universe it would justify God and His Son in their dealing with\nthe rebellion of Satan. It would establish the perpetuity of the law of\nGod and would reveal the nature and the results of sin.\nFrom the first the great controversy had been upon the law of\nGod. SatanhadsoughttoprovethatGodwasunjust,thatHislawwas\nfaulty, and that the good of the universe required it to be changed. In\nattacking the law he aimed to overthrow the authority of its Author.\nIn the controversy it was to be shown whether the divine statutes\nwere defective and subject to change, or perfect and immutable.\nWhen Satan was thrust out of heaven, he determined to make the\nearth his kingdom. When he tempted and overcame Adam and Eve,\nhe thought that he had gained possession of this world; “because,”\nsaid he, “they have chosen me as their ruler.” He claimed that it\nwas impossible that forgiveness should be granted to the sinner, and\ntherefore the fallen race were his rightfulsubjects, andthe worldwas\nhis. But God gave His own dear Son—one equal with Himself—to\nbear the penalty of transgression, and thus He provided a way by\nVindicationofGod’sCharacter,November7 661\nwhich they might be restored to His favor, and brought back to their\nEden home. Christ undertook to redeem mankind and to rescue\nthe world from the grasp of Satan. The great controversy begun in\nheaven was to be decided in the very world, on the very same field,\nthat Satan claimed as his.—Patriarchs and Prophets, 68, 69.\nAll this authority I will give you, and their glory; for this has\nbeen delivered to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.—Luke\n4:6.\nWhen Jesus was led into the wilderness to be tempted, He was\nled by the Spirit of God. He did not invite temptation. He went to\nthe wilderness to be alone, to contemplate His mission and work.\nBy fasting and prayer He was to brace Himself for the bloodstained\npath He must travel. But Satan knew that the Saviour had gone into\nthe wilderness, and he thought this the best time to approach Him.\nMighty issues for the world were at stake in the conflict between\nthe Prince of light and the leader of the kingdom of darkness. After\ntempting Adam and Eve to sin, Satan claimed the earth as his, and\nstyled himself the prince of this world. Having conformed to his\nown nature the father and mother of our race, he thought to establish\nhere his empire. He declared that mankind had chosen him as their\nsovereign. Through his control of them, he held dominion over the\nworld. Christ had come to disprove Satan’s claim. As the Son of\nman, Christ would stand loyal to God. Thus it would be shown\nthat Satan had not gained complete control of the human race, and\nthat his claim to the world was false. All who desired deliverance\nfrom his power would be set free. The dominion that Adam had lost\nthrough sin would be recovered.\nSincetheannouncementtotheserpentinEden,“Iwillputenmity\nbetween thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed”\n(Genesis 3:15), Satan had known that he did not hold absolute sway\nover the world. There was seen in humanity the working of a power\nthat withstood his dominion. With intense interest he watched the\nsacrifices offered by Adam and his sons. In these ceremonies he\ndiscerned a symbol of communion between earth and heaven. He set\nhimself to intercept this communion. He misrepresented God, and\nmisinterpreted the rites that pointed to the Saviour. People were led\nSatan’sClaim,November8 663\nto fear God as one who delighted in their destruction. The sacrifices\nthat should have revealed His love were offered only to appease His\nwrath. Satan excitedpeople’s evilpassions, in orderto fasten his rule\nupon them. When God’s written word was given, Satan studied the\nprophecies of the Saviour’s advent. From generation to generation\nhe worked to blind the people to these prophecies, that they might\nreject Christ at His coming.—The Desire of Ages, 114, 115."

Unfaithful pastors\nhave prophesied smooth things; they have led their hearers to make\nvoid the law of God and to persecute those who would keep it holy.\nNow, in their despair, these teachers confess before the world their\nwork of deception. The multitudes are filled with fury. “We are\nDestinyofTheFalseShepherds,December8 725\nlost!” they cry, “and you are the cause of our ruin;” and they turn\nupon the false shepherds. The very ones that once admired them\nmost will pronounce the most dreadful curses upon them. The very\nhands that once crowned them with laurels will be raised for their\ndestruction. The swords which were to slay God’s people are now\nemployed to destroy their enemies. Everywhere there is strife and\nbloodshed.—The Great Controversy, 654-656."

But all arise with the freshness and vigor of eternal youth.\nIn the beginning, mankind was created in the likeness of God, not\nonly in character, but in form and feature. Sin defaced and almost\nobliterated the divine image; but Christ came to restore that which\nhad been lost. He will change our vile bodies and fashion them\nlike unto His glorious body.

Every dying leaf, every victim of sacrifice, every blight\nupon the fair face of nature, every stain upon mankind’s purity,\nwas a fresh reminder of his sin. Terrible was the agony of remorse\nas he beheld iniquity abounding, and, in answer to his warnings,\nmet the reproaches cast upon himself as the cause of sin.

In union with Christ they judge the wicked,\ncomparing their acts with the statute book, the Bible, and deciding\nevery case according to the deeds done in the body. Then the portion\nwhich the wicked must suffer is meted out, according to their works;\nand it is recorded against their names in the book of death.\nSatan also and evil angels are judged by Christ and His people.\nSays Paul: “Know ye not that we shall judge angels?” (Verse 3.)\nAnd Jude declares that “the angels which kept not their first estate,\nbut left their own habitation, He hath reserved in everlasting chains\nunder darkness unto the judgment of the great day.” (Jude 6.)\nWorkoftheRedeemedDuringtheMillennium,December17 743\nAt the close of the thousand years the second resurrection will\ntake place.
