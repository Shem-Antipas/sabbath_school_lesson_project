God works in man. “Ye are God’s husbandry, ye are\nGod’s building” (1 Corinthians 3:9). In the beginning the Lord\nenjoined upon man the cultivation of the earth.

Why then are there so\nmany disagreeable characters in the world? It is because they do not\nsuspect that their disagreeable ways and rough, impolite speech is\nthe result of an unholy heart....\nIt is the fragrance of our love to our fellow men that reveals our\nlove for God. It is patience in service that brings rest to the soul. It\nis through humble, diligent, faithful toilers that the welfare of Israel\nis promoted. God upholds and strengthens the one who is willing to\nlearn Christ’s way....\nAll right inventions and improvements have their source in Him\nwho is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working. Whatever we\ndo, in whatever department of the work we are placed, God desires\nto refine and ennoble us. He desires to control man’s mind, that he\nmay do perfect work.\nThe delicate touch of the physician’s hand, his power over nerve\nand muscle, his knowledge of the delicate organism of the body,\nis the wisdom of divine power, to be used in behalf of suffering\nhumanity. The skill with which the carpenter uses the hammer, the\nstrength with which the blacksmith makes the anvil ring, comes\nfrom God. He has entrusted men with powers, and He expects that\nthey will look to Him for counsel. Thus they may use His gifts with\nunerring aptitude, testifying to God’s glory that they are workers\ntogether with Him. Thus they purify their souls by sanctification of\nPerfectinHim,January24 65\nthe Spirit through the truth. In their experience, the words of Christ\nare fulfilled, The pure in heart shall see God (see Matthew 5:8).\nAll should feel that they are working to one great end. The work\nin every department is God’s, and those who do that work with\nexactness, without blunder, represent God’s perfection.—Letter 9,"

And while I was suffering in mind, it\nseemed as if I was suffering great bodily pain. My right arm, which\nthrough the years has nearly always been preserved from disease\nand suffering, seemed powerless. I could not lift it.

They do not desire to have their sins and defects brought\nbefore them. They want accommodating ministers, who will not\narouse conviction by speaking the truth.

His true shepherds will not praise and exalt man. They\nwill come before the people with a plain “Thus saith the Lord, the\nHoly One of Israel.” They will bear His message, whether men will\nhear or whether they will forbear. If men despise God’s Word, and\ntrust in oppression, hypocrisy, and worldliness, they must declare\nagainst them God’s denunciations, that, if possible, they may be\naroused to repentance. If they are too proud to repent and confess\ntheir errors, to turn to God, welcoming His salvation and seeking\nHis favor, the Lord will remove His light from them and will leave\nthem to walk in the way they have chosen.\nThose who drive the Lord’s faithful messengers into corners,\nwho discourage them, who stand between them and the people, that\ntheirmessage maynothave the influence Goddesigneditshould, are\nanswerable for the deceptions and heresies that come into the church\nas a result of their course. They have a fearful account to render to\nGod. After the Lord has repeatedly warned His people, and they still\nGodHatesDeception,February16 113\nrefuse to hearken to His voice, and will not be instructed, their guilt\nbecomes peculiarly abhorrent to Him.

The Lord is\nwaiting patiently to instruct every willing soul who will be taught.\nThe fault is not with the willing Instructor, the greatest Teacher the\nworld ever knew, but it is with the learner who holds to his own\nimpressions and ideas, and will not give up his human theories and\ncome in humility to be taught.

He\nwould not have confessed, had he not hoped by so doing to avert the\nconsequences of his crime.

They will, in a general way, acknowl-\nedge their unworthiness, but they refuse to confess the sins whose\nguilt rests upon their conscience, and which have brought the frown\nof God upon His people. Thus many conceal sins of selfishness,\noverreaching, dishonesty toward God and their neighbor, sins in the\nfamily, and many others which it is proper to confess in public.\nGenuine repentance springs from a sense of the offensive char-\nacter of sin.

They leave the sinner with a self-\ncomplacent spirit to go on as before, until his conscience becomes\nhardened, and warnings that once aroused him produce hardly a\nfeeling of danger and after a time his sinful course appears right.

All who love Jesus and keep the commandments\nwill seek to avoid the very appearance of evil; not because they are\nconstrained thus to do, but because they are copying a pure model,\nand feel averse to everything contrary to the law written in their\nhearts. They will not feel self-sufficient, but their trust will be in\nGod, who alone is able to keep them from sin and impurity. The\natmosphere surrounding them is pure; they will not corrupt their\nown souls or the souls of others. It is their pleasure to deal justly, to\nlove mercy, and to walk humbly before God.\nThe danger that lies before those living in these last days, is\nthe absence of pure religion, the absence of heart holiness. The\nconverting power of God has not wrought in transforming their\ncharacters. They profess to believe sacred truths as did the Jewish\nnation; but in their failing to practice the truth, they are ignorant both\nof the Scriptures and the power of God. The power and influence of\nGod’s law are around about, but not within the soul, renewing it in\ntrue holiness....\nGod designs that the teacher of the Bible should in his character\nand home life be a specimen of the principles of the truth which he\nis teaching to his fellow men.\nWhat a man is, has a greater influence than what he says.

Never should Christians feel that they are lords over God’s\nheritage. There should not be among Christians a spirit which makes\nsome patrons and some proteges. The commandments of God forbid\nthis. “All ye are brethren” (Matthew 23:8). No man is to think that\nhe is the owner of the minds and capabilities of his brethren. He\nis not to think that others must submit to his dictation. He is liable\nto err, liable to make mistakes, as every man is. He is not to try to\ncontrol matters in accordance with his ideas.\nHe who yields to this spirit of self-exaltation places himself\nunder the control of the enemy. If ministers of the gospel cannot\nharmonize with all his ideas and imaginings, he turns from them and\nspeaks against them, pouring out the sarcasm and bitterness in his\nheart upon ministers and ministry.\nNone of this work bears the signature of Heaven.

Paul’s sanctification was a daily conflict with self. Said\nhe, “I die daily” (1 Corinthians 15:31). His will and his desires\ndaily conflicted with duty and the will of God. In the plan of not\nfollowing inclination, he did the will of God, however unpleasant\nand crucifying to his nature.

This caused much perplexity and regret. It was\nunusual to dispense with wine on festive occasions, and its absence\nwould seem to indicate a want of hospitality. As a relative of the\nparties, Mary had assisted in the arrangements for the feast, and she\nnow spoke to Jesus, saying, “They have no wine” (John 2:3). These\nwords were a suggestion that He might supply their need. But Jesus\nanswered, “Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not\nyet come” (Verse 4).\nThe response of Christ did not discourage His mother. At the\nright moment He would act His part. “His mother saith unto the\nservants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. And there were set\nthere six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the\nJews, containing two or three firkins apiece. Jesus saith unto them,\nFill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.\nAnd he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor\nof the feast. And they bare it” (Verses 5-8).\nWhen the time had fully come, the miracle wrought by Christ\nwas recognized. As soon as the ruler of the feast put the goblet to\nhis lips and tasted the wine, he looked up with glad surprise. The\nwine was superior to any he had ever before drunk. And it was\nunfermented wine. He said to the bridegroom, “Every man at the\nbeginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk,\nthen that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until\nnow” (Verse 10).\nChrist did not approach the jars, or touch the water; He simply\nlooked upon the water, and it became the pure juice of the grape,\nclarified and refined. What effect did this miracle have?—“His\nWaterintoWine,December23 755\ndisciples believed on him” (Verse 11).... By this miracle Christ also\ngave evidence of His mercy and compassion.

        "content": "Foreword\nA different plan has been adopted in assembling the materials\nfor this E. G. White devotional book. Rather than gathering se-\nlections on a central theme, we have chosen, somewhat at random,\nappropriate inspirational messages written or presented orally by\nEllen White on every calendar day of the year. The writings, usually\nan unbroken unit, have been chosen from forty-six of the seventy\nyears of Ellen White’s ministry. Selecting the items from letters of\ncounsel and encouragement and sermons and articles has afforded\nan opportunity for choice presentations on a wide range of helpful\ntopics.\nThisprocedurehasopenedupsomeinterestingandoftenunusual\ninsights into the ministry of God’s special messenger. For example,\nwe note her frequent habit of writing important counsel early in the\nmorning while the rest of the household slept. It was so in 1905.\nThe New Year was just one hour old when Ellen White arose that\nSunday morning, and made her way to her writing room to start the\nday’s activities. Of this she wrote:\nIt is a cool morning. Built my fire. Bowed before the Lord in\nprayer. I have so many things burdening my mind. I asked the Lord\nJesus to direct me, to guide me. What shall I trace with my Pen\nthis morning? ... I need the great guide to control my mind. What\nshall I trace with the pen first? ...Oh, how much I feel that I need the\nguidance of the Holy Spirit.—Manuscript 173, 1905.\nShe was in her comfortable writing room on the eastern end\nof the second floor at Elmshaven, well known to many Seventh-\nday Adventists. That morning the Holy Spirit led her mind first to\nthe students of Oakwood college, for whom she wrote a four-page\nmessage of encouragement. In the years before this her writing had\nbeen done in a variety of settings such as her sunnyside home at\nCooranbong in Australia; her apartment on the second floor of the\ncentral publishing house in basel, switzerland; her healdsburg home\nclose to the college in Northern California; and her home at Battle\nxiii\nxiv ThisDayWithGod\nCreek. In early years at Battle Creek when her home was small and\noften filled with children and visitors, she wrote in the corner of the\nlibrary at the Review and Herald office.\nTravel by train, boat, or horse and buggy did not prevent her\n[7] from writing. At the close of this book a short historical outline of\nher activities and travels will provide a general setting for a number\nof the readings.\nEarlyin herworkEllen White chose to include personalcounsels\nin her published books, because the “warning and instruction” that\napplied to one person often contained principles and advice that\nmight well apply to another (see Testimonies for the Church 5:658,\n659). She was not given light for each individual who might be in\nneed of counsel.\nIn 1905, at the age of 77, as she was nearing the close of her\nlifetime of heavy correspondence, she wrote, “I am endeavoring by\nthe help of God to write letters that will be a help, not merely to\nthose to whom they are addressed, but to many others who need\nthem.”—Letter 79, 1905.\nSuchletters mightbe devotedentirelyto an importantmessage to\nthe person addressed, or, if to an acquaintance, might contain some\nnewsy items, as well as spiritual truths based on the many visions\ngiven to her through the years. Selections from the thousands of\nsuch letters in the Ellen G. White files make up much of this volume.\nSome are letters to presidents of the General Conference, some were\nwritten to local conference executives. One is a letter to a harassed\nmother. Others are letters to sanitarium managers, to physicians,\nto individuals under heavy temptations, to young people, and to\nsaints in their golden years. There are letters to businessmen and to\neditors of the Review and Herald. Some were written to her own\nsons, who, like any Seventh-day Adventist, stood in need of counsel\nand encouragement. A number of letters were to women workers\nand wives of workers.\nGeneral manuscripts, penned to meet various situations, were\ndrawn upon in this collection, as were her extensive daily writings\nand diaries. These abound in spiritual lessons, encouragement, and\ncounsel. Hundreds of sermons were reported stenographically and\nare on file as E. G. White manuscripts. All of these manuscripts\nprovide rich sources for the readings in this volume\nForeword xv\nFor variety, a few excerpts are taken from her periodical articles\nthat appeared in the weekly issues of the Review and Herald and\nSigns of the Times over a period of more than sixty years.\nA source reference appears with each reading, giving its file\nreferenceaswellasthename, position, andlocation oftheindividual\naddressed. For sermons and manuscripts, the title together with the\nyear and date of writing are provided. These credit lines provide [8]\nthe setting for the devotional message. If the person addressed held\ndifferent positions through the years, he is identified by the one he\nheld at the time Ellen White wrote to him.\nIf a message chosen by Ellen White for publication was highly\npersonal or confidential, she was careful to protect the identity of\nthe person addressed. With her practice in mind, we have omit-\nted a few names in this book. In all other instances, however, we\nhave included the names and places because they contribute to a\nbetter understanding of the counsel given. This information provides\nsidelights otherwise not known, and helps to make this devotional\nvolume a treasure of counsel for persons of all ages.\nCertain names appear frequently—Dr. J. H. Kellogg, medical\nsuperintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitarium; Elders G. I. Butler\nand A. G. Daniells, presidents of the General Conference; G. B.\nStarr, evangelist and sanitarium chaplain; J. A. Burden, sanitarium\nmanager in Australia and California; and W. C. White, who assisted\nhis mother and filled a number of important leadership positions in\nthe Church. Several letters are addressed to her other son, Edson\nWhite, or to Edson and Emma White after their marriage in 1870.\nSome choice messages of counsel to newlyweds were written to\nEdson and Emma in theirearly married life. Edson’s careertook him\nthroughpublishinghousemanagement,songwritingandpublication,\nSabbath school leadership, and finally pioneer missionary work\namong the blacks in the Southern States.\nIn three or four instances, paragraphs have been rearranged so\nthat the selection ends on a positive tone. Otherwise, the paragraphs\nappear as they were first written by Ellen White.\nIt is our prayer that This Day With God will help you to face\neach day with increased gratitude for God’s grace and with renewed\ndetermination to live in harmony with his will so that we may all\nstand with the redeemed on the sea of glass in heaven.\nxvi ThisDayWithGod\nThe Trustees of the Ellen G. White Estate\nJanuary"
