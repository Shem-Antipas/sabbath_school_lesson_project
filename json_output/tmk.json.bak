Though He was the King of glory, yet by His\npractice of following a humble employment He rebuked idleness in\nevery member of the human family, and dignified all labor as noble\nand Christlike.... From childhood He was a pattern of obedience and\nindustry. He was as a pleasant sunbeam in the home circle....\nThough His wisdom had astonished the doctors, yet He meekly\nsubjected Himself to His human guardians.... The knowledge He\nwas daily obtaining of His wonderful mission did not disqualify Him\nfor performing the most humble duties. He cheerfully took up the\nwork that devolves upon youth who dwell in humble households\npressed by poverty. He understood the temptations of children, for\nHe bore their sorrows and trials. Firm and steadfast was His purpose\nto do the right. Though enticed to evil, He refused to depart in a\nsingle instance from the strictest truth and rectitude.48\nChrist is the ideal for all humanity. He has left a perfect example\nfor childhood, youth, and manhood. He came to this earth, and\npassed through the different phases of human life. He talked and\nacted like other children and youth, except that He did no wrong.\nSin found no place in His life. Ever He lived in an atmosphere of\nheavenly purity....\nIn the sanctuary of the home, Jesus received His education, not\nmerely from His parents, but from His heavenly Father. As He grew\nolder, God opened to Him more and more of the great work before\nHim. But notwithstanding His knowledge of this, He assumed no\nairs of superiority. Never did He by disrespect cause His parents\npain or anxiety. He delighted to honor and obey them. Although He\n48SignsoftheTimes,July30,1896.\nIdealforAllHumanity,January24 65\nwas not ignorant of His great mission, He consulted their wishes,\nand submitted to their authority.49\n49S.D.A.

If Christ had a special power\nwhich it is not the privilege of man to have, Satan would have made\ncapital of this matter. The work of Christ was to take from the claims\nof Satan his control of man, and He could do this only in the way\nthat He came—a man, tempted as a man, rendering the obedience\nof a man.56\nWould that we could comprehend the significance of the words,\nChrist “suffered being tempted” (Hebrews 2:18). While He was\nfree from the taint of sin, the refined sensibilities of His holy nature\nrendered contact with evil unspeakably painful to Him. Yet with\nhuman nature upon Him, He met the arch apostate face to face, and\nsinglehanded withstood the foe of His throne. Not even by a thought\ncould Christ be brought to yield to the power of temptation.\nSatan finds in human hearts some point where he can gain a\nfoothold; some sinful desire is cherished, by means of which his\ntemptations assert their power.

Thus the world’s Redeemer\nillustrates the work of the Holy Spirit upon the human heart.

There must be a continual exercise of faith to be in Christ and\nkeep in Christ, abiding by faith in Him.\nThis is a training process, a constant discipline of the mind and\nheart, that Christ shall work His great work in human hearts. Self,\nthe old natural self, dies, and Christ’s will is our will, His way is our\nway, and the human agent becomes, with heart, mind, and intellect,\nan instrument in the hands of God to work no more wickedness but\nthe righteousness of Christ....\nIn the divine arrangement God does nothing without the cooper-\nation of man. He compels no man’s will. That must be given to the\nLord completely, else the Lord is not able to accomplish His divine\nwork that He would do through the human agency. Jesus declared\nthat in a certain place He could not do many mighty works among\nthe people because of their unbelief. He wanted to do for them in\nthat place just what He knew that they needed to have done, but\nHe could not because unbelief barred the way.

He could have said in truth, “Behold,\nand see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow” (Lamentations\n1:12). His suffering was the deepest anguish of the soul; and what\nman could have sympathy with the soul anguish of the Son of the\ninfinite God? Hating sin with a perfect hatred, He yet gathered to\nHis soul the sins of the whole world, as He trod the path to Calvary,\nsuffering the penalty of the transgressor.

Our great High Priest places His righteousness on\nthe side of the sincere suppliant, and the prayer of Christ blends with\nthat of the human petitioner.\nChrist has urged that His people pray without ceasing. This does\nnot mean that we should always be upon our knees, but that prayer is\nto be as the breath of the soul. Our silent requests, wherever we may\nbe, are to be ascending unto God, and Jesus our Advocate pleads\nin our behalf, bearing up with the incense of His righteousness our\nrequests to the Father.\nThe Lord Jesus loves His people, and when they put their trust\nin Him, depending wholly upon Him, He strengthens them. He will\nlive through them, giving them the inspiration of His sanctifying\nSpirit, imparting to the soul a vital transfusion of Himself. He acts\nthrough their faculties and causes them to choose His will and to act\nout His character. With the apostle Paul they then may say, “I am\ncrucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth\nin me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of\nthe Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me” (Galatians\n2:20)....\nThe Lord will not leave His afflicted, tried children to be the\nsport of Satan’s temptations.

The Lord Jesus laid aside His royal crown, He\nleft His high command, He clothed His divinity with humanity, in\norder that through humanity He might uplift the human race.

Coming to Christ does not require a severe mental\neffort and agony. It is simply accepting the terms of salvation that\nGod has made plain in His Word.24\nGod desires the willing service of our hearts. He has endowed\nus with reasoning faculties, with talents of ability, and with means\nand influence, to be exercised for the good of mankind, that we may\nmanifest His spirit before the world.

Why “cannot” the world\nreceive the truth? “Because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him”\n(verse 17). The world is leagued against the truth, because it does\nnot desire to obey the truth.

All the cruel taunts of the murderous throng who\nexulted in His humiliation and trial in the judgment hall could not\nbring from Him one look or word of resentment or impatience.

Through all these centuries\nthe truth of God has remained the same. That which was truth in\nthe beginning is truth now. Although new and important truths\nappropriate for succeeding generations have been opened to the\nunderstanding, the present revealings do not contradict those of the\npast. Every new truth understood only makes more significant the\nold.14\nCommencing with the Fall, down through the patriarchal and\nJewish ages even to the present time, there has been a gradual un-\nfolding of the purposes of God in the plan of redemption. Noah,\nAbraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses understood the gospel through\nChrist; they looked for the salvation of the race through man’s sub-\nstitute and surety. These holy men of old held communion with the\nSaviour who was to come to our world in human flesh, and some of\nthem talked with Christ and heavenly angels face to face, as a man\ntalks with his friend.15\nAs time has rolled on from Creation and the cross of Calvary, as\nprophecy has been and is still fulfilling, light and knowledge have\ngreatly increased.... In the life and death of Christ, a light flashes\nback upon the past, giving significance to the whole Jewish econ-\nomy, and making of the old and the new dispensations a complete\nwhole. Nothing that God has ordained in the plan of redemption\ncan be dispensed with. It is the working out of the divine will in the\nsalvation of man.16\n14TheReviewandHerald,March2,1886.\n15SignsoftheTimes,February21,1911.\n16TheReviewandHerald,March2,1886.\nBookoftheAges,July10 409\nAll the truths of revelation are of value to us, and in contem-\nplating things of eternal interest, we shall gain true perceptions of\nthe character of God....

Faith in Jesus Christ as your\npersonal Saviour will give strength and solidity to your character.\nThose who have faith in Christ will be sober-minded, ever remem-\nbering that God’s eye is upon them, that angels of God are watching\nto see what manner of characters they will develop....\nIndividually, probation is granted to you in order that you may\nform characters for the future, immortal life. Precious, golden mo-\nments are given you that you may improve them according to the\nlight which the Lord has graciously permitted to shine upon you\nfrom the throne of His glory.... Christ is the greatest teacher the\nworld ever knew. Where He abides in the heart by faith, His spirit\nwill become a vitalizing agent to purify and vivify the soul....\nThe truth in the heart will surely have a correcting influence\non the character. Hold the truth as from God, as a treasure of the\nhighest value, that must not be dimmed or tarnished by evil practices\nthat are wholly out of harmony with its holy character.

        "content": "Our work is to “resist the devil,” not harbor his doubts; and if we\ndo this, the promise is “he will flee from you.”\nBut the question is often asked, How can I resist Satan? There is\nonly one way by which you can do this, and that is by faith, taking\nChrist as your helper and pleading with Him for strength. When\nSatan suggests doubt to your soul, when he tells you that you are too\nunworthy, too sinful, to realize the blessing of God, present Christ\nbefore him as your Advocate and Saviour. Tell him you know that\nyou are a sinner, but that Jesus came to seek and save that which was\nlost. He came “not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance”\n(Mark 2:17).\nRepeat His promises: “Him that cometh to me I will in no wise\ncast out” (John 6:37).... “Let him take hold of my strength, that\nhe may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me”\n(Isaiah 27:5). “Whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye\nshall receive” (Matthew 21:22). Be simplehearted enough to believe\nthese promises of God. When Satan comes to you, and tells you\nthat because you are unhappy, perplexed, and troubled you are not a\nchild of God, do not become discouraged for one moment, but gird\nup the loins of your mind. Let your heart repose in God. He has\npromised that if you come to Him, you shall find rest to your soul;\nand if you have done this, rest assured that He will fulfill His word\nin you....\nMany pass long years in darkness and doubt because they do not\nfeel as they desire. But feeling has nothing to do with faith. That\nfaith which works by love and purifies the soul is not a matter of\nimpulse. It ventures out upon the promises of God, firmly believing\nthat what He has said, He is able also to perform. Our souls may\nbe trained to believe, taught to rely upon the Word of God. That\nHowtoResistSatan,August27 507\nWord declares that “the just shall live by faith” (Romans 1:17), not\nby feeling.38\n38TheYouth’sInstructor,July8,1897."

Whenever one takes a step toward Jesus, Jesus\nis taking steps toward him. The angels’ work is to keep back the\npowers of Satan.40\nThose who are ever pressing a little closer to the world, and\nbecoming more like them in feelings, in plans, in ideas, have left\na space between them and the Saviour, and Satan has pressed his\nway into this space, and low, worldly-tainted, selfish plans become\ninterwoven with their experience.41\nIf we draw nigh to God, we shall draw nigh to one another.\nWe cannot draw nigh to the same cross without coming into unity\nof spirit. Christ prayed that His disciples should be one as He\nand the Father are one. We should seek to be one in spirit and in\nunderstanding.

Adversity and trial will only give them an opportunity to show\nthe sincerity of their faith and love. When depression settles upon\nthe soul, it is no evidence that God has changed. He is “the same\nyesterday, and to day, and for ever” (Hebrews 13:8). You are sure of\nthe favor of God when you are sensible of the beams of the Sun of\nRighteousness; but if the clouds sweep over your soul, you must not\nfeel that you are forsaken. Your faith must pierce the gloom.... The\nriches of the grace of Christ must be kept before the mind. Treasure\nup the lessons that His love provides. Let your faith be like Job’s,\nthat you may declare, “Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him”\n(Job 13:15). Lay hold on the promises of your heavenly Father and\nremember His former dealing with you and with His servants, for\n“all things work together for good to them that love God.”\nThe most trying experiences in the Christian’s life may be the\nmost blessed. The special providences of the dark hours may en-\ncourage the soul in future attacks of Satan, and equip the servant of\nGod to stand in fiery trials.

Daniel knew that the appointed time\nfor Israel’s captivity was nearly ended, but he did not feel that be-\ncauseGodhadpromisedtodeliverthem, theythemselveshadnopart\nto act. With fasting and contrition he sought the Lord, confessing\nhis own sins and the sins of the people....\nDaniel makes no plea on the ground of his own goodness, but he\nsays: “O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and\nbehold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name:\nfor we do not present our supplications before thee for our righ-\nteousnesses, but for thy great mercies” (Daniel 9:18). His intensity\nof desire makes him earnest and fervent. He continues: “O Lord,\nhear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine\nown sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy\nname.”...\nWhat a prayer was that which came forth from the lips of Daniel!\nWhat humbling of soul it reveals! The warmth of heavenly fire was\nrecognized in the words that were going upward to God. Heaven\nresponded to that prayer by sending its messenger to Daniel. In this\nour day, prayers offered in like manner will prevail with God. “The\neffectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much” (James\n5:16). As in ancient times, when prayer was offered, fire descended\nfrom heaven and consumed the sacrifice upon the altar, so in answer\nto our prayers, the heavenly fire will come into our souls. The light\nand power of the Holy Spirit will be ours.... That God who heard\nDaniel’s prayer will hear ours when we come to Him in contrition.\nDaniel’sExampleofPrayerandConfession,September22 561\nOur necessities are as urgent, our difficulties are as great, and we\nneed to have the same intensity of purpose, and in faith roll our\nburden upon the great Burden Bearer.

The violence here meant is a holy earnestness, such as Jacob\nmanifested. We need not try to work ourselves up into an intense\nfeeling, but calmly, persistently, we are to press our petitions at\nthe throne of grace. Our work is to humble our souls before God,\nconfessing our sins, and in faith drawing nigh unto God.... It is\nthe design of God to reveal Himself in His providence and in His\ngrace. The object of our prayers must be the glory of God, not the\nglorification of ourselves....\nGod has honored us by showing how greatly He values us. We\nare bought with a price, even the precious blood of the Son of God.\nWhen His heritage shall conscientiously follow the Word of the\nLord, His blessing will rest upon them in answer to their prayers.\n“Therefore also now, saith the Lord, turn ye even to me with all your\nheart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: and\nrend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your\nGod: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great\nkindness” (Joel 2:12, 13).28\nIn secret prayer the soul should be laid bare to the inspecting eye\nof God.... How precious is secret prayer—the soul communing with\nGod! Secret prayer is to be heard only by the prayer-hearing God.\nNo curious ear is to receive the burden of petitions. Calmly, yet\nfervently, the soul is to reach out after God; and sweet and abiding\nwill be the influence emanating from Him who sees in secret, whose\n28Ibid.\nPreciousnessofSecretPrayer,September23 563\near is open to the prayer arising from the heart.

Numberless pens have been employed to represent the life\nand character and mediatorial work of Christ, and yet to every mind\nthrough whom the Holy Spirit works these themes are presented\nfresh and new, just in accordance with the mind and spirit of the\nhuman agent. TheLordJesuspromisedthattheSpiritHewouldsend\nwould recall His words to the minds of those prepared to receive\nthem. After His resurrection He opened their understanding, that\nthey might understand the Scriptures. Up to that time the disciples\nhad not comprehended them, for the rubbish of rabbinical lore had\nhidden the truth from their view.\nThe truth, if received, is capable of constant expansion and new\ndevelopments. It will increase in brightness as we behold it, and\ngrow in height and depth as we aspire to grasp it. Thus it will elevate\nus to the standard of perfection, and give us faith and trust in God\nas our strength for the work before us. We need the truth as it is in\nJesus.... As His representatives and witnesses we need to come to a\nfull understanding of the saving truth which we must know by an\nexperimental knowledge.\n“In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the\nforgiveness of sins” (Colossians 1:14). This is the great practical\ntruth which must be stamped upon the soul. It is of the greatest\nFullnessoftheGodhead,November30 703\nimportance that all should comprehend the greatness and power of\nthe truth to those who receive it. “In him dwelleth all the fulness of\nthe Godhead bodily” (Colossians 2:9).38\n38Manuscript153,1898.\n704 ThatIMayKnowHim\nDecember"

You will see\nHim who laid aside His royal garments and His kingly crown, and\ndisguising Himself with humanity, came to our world and bore our\nsins, that He might lift us up and give us a revelation of His glory\nand majesty. We shall see Him face to face if we now give ourselves\nup to be molded and fashioned by Him and prepared for a place in\nthe kingdom of God.\nThose who consecrate their lives to the service of God will live\nwith Him through the ceaseless ages of eternity. “God himself shall\nbe with them, and be their God” (Revelation 21:3)....\nTheir minds were given to God in this world; they served Him\nwith their heart and intellect, and now He can put His name in their\nforeheads. “Andthereshallnonightthere; ... fortheLordGodgiveth\nthem light: and they shall reign for ever and ever” (Revelation 22:5).\nThey do not go in as those that beg a place there, for Christ says to\nthem, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared\nforyoufromthefoundationoftheworld”(Matthew25:34).

Only a few pages\nduplicate what is found in the current Ellen G. White books. More\nthan half of the book is drawn from the wealth of inspired material\nin the articles from her pen that appeared during her long lifetime\nin such periodicals as the Review and Herald, Youth’s Instructor,\nand Signs of the Times. About one third is drawn from unpublished\nmanuscripts and letters in the custody of the Trustees of the Ellen\nG. White writings, under whose direction the volume has been\nprepared. Many of these unpublished items are from personal heart-\nto-heart messages sent to individuals—messages that come to us\ntoday with the same earnest appeal, the same tender admonition and\nencouragement, as when they were written. Of special interest are\nseveral pages which contain extracts from early morning entries in\nEllen White’s diary, and give the reader significant glimpses into her\npersonal prayer life.\nIn order to bring each reading into the compass of a single page,\nfrequent deletions have been necessary, and these are indicated in\nthe usual way. Great care has been exercised to preserve without\ndistortion the thought and intent of the writer. It should be noted\nthat when lines from a hymn or a poem appear they were quoted by\nEllen White herself. The daily memory verses have been chosen to\nharmonize with the message of each day.\n“That I May Know Him” goes forth with our hope and prayer\nthat it may truly help its readers to become better acquainted with\nour Lord and Saviour, to have a deeper appreciation of His amazing\nsacrifice for lost mankind, to gain clearer views of the beauty and\nperfection of His character, and to understand better the heights\nwe may reach in our own character development, as clothed in the\nxiv\nForeword xv\ngarments of His righteousness we strive to become “complete in\nHim.”\nThe Trustees of the Ellen G.
