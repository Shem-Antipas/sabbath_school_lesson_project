When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of\nGod lifts up for them a standard against him. There is harmony in\nthe heart, for the precious, powerful influences of truth bear sway.\nThe Word of God is a channel of communication with the living\nGod. He who feeds upon the Word will become fruitful in all good\nmust work to find the hidden treasure. When [he is] surrounded with\ntemptations, the Holy Spirit will bring to his mind the very words\nwith which to meet the temptation at the very moment when they\nare most needed, and he can use them effectually.\nWe must be better acquainted with our Bibles. We might close\nthe door to many temptations, if we would commit to memory pas-\nsages of Scripture. Let us hedge up the way to Satan’s temptations\nwith “It is written.” We shall meet with conflicts to test our faith\nand courage, but they will make us strong if we conquer through the\ngrace Jesus is willing to give.

Ephesians 1:3, 4.\nSince the Fall the Lord has wrought out His will in the plan of\nredemption, a plan by which He is seeking to restore man to his\noriginal perfection. Christ’s death on the cross has made it possible\nfor God to receive and pardon every repentant soul.\nAs the divine Sufferer hung upon the cross, angels gathered\nabout Him, and as they looked upon Him, and heard His cry, they\nasked, with intense emotion, “Will not the Lord Jehovah save Him?”\nnot repent. Father and Son are pledged to fulfill the terms of the\neverlasting covenant. God so loved the world, that He gave His only-\nbegotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish,\nbut have everlasting life.” Christ was not alone in making His great\nsacrifice. It was the fulfillment of the covenant made between Him\nand His Father before the foundation of the world was laid. With\nclasped hands they had entered into the solemn pledge that Christ\nwould become the surety for the human race if they were overcome\nby Satan’s sophistry.\nThe salvation of the human race has ever been the object of the\ncouncils of heaven. The covenant of mercy was made before the\nfoundation of the world. It has existed from all eternity, and is called\nthe everlasting covenant. So surely as there never was a time when\nGod was not, so surely there never was a moment when it was not\nthe delight of the eternal mind to manifest His grace to humanity.\nThe more we consider this subject, the greater depths we find,\nand yet there are depths that we do not reach as we study the Re-\ndeemer’s glory. It is the glory of the Prince of life, and the mightiest\n134 TheFaithILiveBy\npowers of man cannot reach it.

The\ncovenant of grace was first made with man in Eden, when after the\nFall, there was given a divine promise that the seed of the woman\nshould bruise the serpent’s head. To all men this covenant offered\npardon, and the assisting grace of God for future obedience through\nfaith in Christ. It also promised them eternal life on condition of\nfidelity to God’s law. Thus the patriarchs received the hope of\nsalvation.\nThis same covenant was renewed to Abraham in the promise,\n“In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” Genesis\n22:18. This promise pointed to Christ. So Abraham understood\nit, and he trusted in Christ for the forgiveness of sins. It was this\nfaith that was accounted unto him for righteousness. The covenant\nwith Abraham also maintained the authority of God’s law. The Lord\nappeared unto Abraham, and said, “I am the Almighty God; walk\nbefore me, and be thou perfect.” The testimony of God concerning\nHis faithful servant was, “Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my\ncharge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.” Genesis\nThe Abrahamic covenant was ratified by the blood of Christ, and\nit is called the “second,” or “new,” covenant, because the blood by\nwhich it was sealed was shed after the blood of the first covenant.\nThe covenant of grace is not a new truth, for it existed in the\nmind of God from all eternity. This is why it is called the everlasting\ncovenant.\nThere is hope for us only as we come under the Abrahamic\ncovenant, which is the covenant of grace by faith in Christ Jesus.\n136 TheFaithILiveBy\nThe gospel preached to Abraham, through which he had hope, was\nJesus, who is also the author and the finisher of our faith."

        "content": "Faith is not certainty of knowledge, it is the substance of things\nhoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\nFaith is trusting in God—believing that He loves us, and knows\nwhat is for our best good. Thus, instead of our own way, it leads\nus to choose His way. In place of our ignorance, it accepts His\nwisdom; in place of our weakness, His strength; in place of our\nsinfulness, His righteousness. Our lives, ourselves, are already His;\nfaith acknowledges His ownership, and accepts its blessing. Truth,\nuprightness, purity, are pointed out as secrets of life’s success. It\nis faith that puts us in possession of these. Every good impulse or\naspiration is the gift of God; faith receives from God the life that\nalone can produce true growth and efficiency.\nWhen we speak of faith, there is a distinction that should be\nborne in mind. There is a kind of belief that is wholly distinct\nfrom faith. The existence and power of God, the truth of His Word,\nare facts that even Satan and his hosts cannot at heart deny. The\nBible says that “the devils also believe, and tremble”; but this is\nnot faith. Where there is not only a belief in God’s Word, but a\nsubmission of the will to Him; where the heart is yielded to Him,\nthe affections fixed upon Him, there is faith—faith that works by\nlove and purifies the soul. Through this faith the heart is renewed\nin the image of God. And the heart that in its unrenewed state is\nnot subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be, now delights\nin its holy precepts, exclaiming with the psalmist, “O how love I\nthy law! it is my meditation all the day.” Psalm 119:97.

Worldly maxims and worldly practices sap spirituality\nfrom heart and life. Conformity to the world means resemblance to\nworld and Jesus Christ at the same time. There is an irreconcilable\nantagonism, between Christ and the world.\nHow few can say: “I am dead to the world; the life I now live\nvain and engaged in pleasure-seeking and folly, our conversation is\nin heaven, whence we look for the Saviour; the soul is reaching out\nafter God for pardon and peace, for righteousness and true holiness.\nConverse with God and contemplation of things above transform the\nsoul into the likeness of Christ.\nLet your heart be softened and melted under the divine influence\nof the Spirit of God. You should not talk so much about yourself,\nbe submerged in Christ."

A few moments\nhere and a few there, that might be frittered away in aimless talk; the\nmorning hours so often wasted in bed; the time spent in traveling\non trams or railway cars, or waiting at the station; the moments of\nwaiting for meals, waiting for those who are tardy in keeping an\nappointment—if a book were kept at hand, and these fragments of\ntime were improvedin study, reading, orcarefulthought, whatmight\nnot be accomplished.

And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. Genesis 28:16, 17. True reverence for God is inspired by a sense of His infinite greatness and a realization of His presence. With this sense of the Unseen, every heart should be deeply impressed. The hour and place of prayer are sacred, because God is there. And as reverence is manifested in attitude and demeanor, the feeling that inspires it will be deepened. “Holy and reverend is his name,” the psalmist declares (Psalm 111:9). Angels, when they speak that name, veil their faces. With what reverence, then, should we, who are fallen and sinful, take it upon our lips! Well would it be for old and young to ponder those words of Scripture that show how the place marked by God’s special presence should be regarded. “Put off thy shoes from off thy feet,” He commanded Moses at the burning bush, “for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.” Exodus 3:5.",

He committed to them\nthe new covenant, by which all who receive Him become children\nof God, and joint heirs with Christ. By this covenant every blessing\nthat Heaven could bestow for this life and the life to come was theirs.\nThis covenant deed was to be ratified with the blood of Christ. And\nthe administration of the sacrament was to keep before the disciples\nthe infinite sacrifice made for each of them individually as a part of\nthe great whole of fallen humanity.\nBut the communion service was not to be a season of sorrowing.\nThis was not its purpose. As the Lord’s disciples gather about His\ntable, they are not to remember and lament their shortcomings. They\nare not to dwell upon their past religious experience, whether that\nexperience has been elevating or depressing. They are not to recall\nthe differences between them and their brethren. The preparatory\nservice has embraced all this. The self-examination, the confession\nof sin, the reconciling of differences, has all been done. Now they\ncome to meet with Christ. They are not to stand in the shadow of\nthe cross, but in its saving light. They are to open the soul to the\nbright beams of the Sun of Righteousness. With hearts cleansed by\nChrist’s most precious blood, in full consciousness of His presence,\nalthough unseen, they are to hear His words, “Peace I leave with\nyou, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto\nyou.” John 14:27.\nThe atoning sacrifice is full and sufficient. It is the new covenant,\nsealed with His blood, which was shed for many for the remission\nof sins. This Christ declared at the Last Supper. In this cup there is\nto those who drink in faith, peace-making, soul-cleansing efficacy.\n“TheNewTestamentinMyBlood”,October22 537\nIt is the balm of Gilead, which God has provided to restore health\nand soundness to the sin-stricken soul.\nFor as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do\nshew the Lord’s death till he come. 1 Corinthians 11:26.\nThe salvation of men depends upon a continual application to\ntheir hearts of the cleansing blood of Christ. Therefore, the Lord’s\nSupper was not to be observed only occasionally or yearly, but\nmore frequently than the annual Passover. This solemn ordinance\ncommemoratesafargreatereventthanthedeliveranceofthechildren\nof Israel from Egypt. That deliverance was typical of the great\natonement which Christ made by the sacrifice of His own life for the\nfinal deliverance of His people.\nThis ordinance is not to be exclusive, as many would make it.\nEach must participate in it publicly, and thus bear witness: I accept\nChrist as my personal Saviour. He gave His life for me, that I might\nbe rescued from death.\nThe communion service points to Christ’s second coming. It\nwas designed to keep this hope vivid in the minds of the disciples.\nWhenever they met together to commemorate His death, they re-\ncounted how “he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,\nsaying, Drink ye all of it; for this is my blood of the new testament,\nwhich is shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say unto\nyou, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that\nday when I drink it new with you in my father’s kingdom.” Matthew\n26:27-29. In their tribulation they found comfort in the hope of their\nLord’s return. Unspeakably precious to them was the thought, “As\noften as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s\nChrist has instituted this service that it may speak to our senses\nGod except through Christ. The union and love between brother\nand brother must be cemented and rendered eternal by the love of\nJesus. And nothing less than the death of Christ could make His\nAsOftasyeEatandDrink,October23 539\nlove efficacious for us. It is only because of His death that we can\nlook with joy to His second coming. His sacrifice is the center of\nour hope."

It should be the aim of\nyour life to fit yourself for association with the redeemed, with holy\nangels, and with Jesus, the world’s Redeemer. If we could have but\none view of the celestial city, we would never wish to dwell on earth\nagain. There are beautiful landscapes on earth, and I enjoy all these\nprospects of loveliness in nature. I associate them with the Creator.\nBut I know that if I love God, and keep His commandments, there is\na far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory reserved in heaven\nfor me.\nThere, when the veil that darkens our vision shall be removed,\nand our eyes shall behold that world of beauty of which we now\ncatch glimpses through the microscope; when we look on the glories\nof the heavens, now scanned afar through the telescope; when, the\nblight of sin removed, the whole earth shall appear in “the beauty of\nthe Lord our God,” what a field will be open to our study! There the\nstudent of science may read the records of creation and discern no\nreminders of the law of evil.

In all\ncreated things he may trace one handwriting—in the vast universe\nbehold “God’s name writ large,” and not in earth or sea or sky one\nsign of ill remaining.\nLet your imagination picture the home of the saved, and remem-\nber that it will be more glorious than your brightest imagination can\nportray. In the varied gifts of God in nature we see but the faintest\ngleaming of His glory.\n654 TheFaithILiveBy\nHuman language is inadequate to describe the reward of the\nrighteous.
