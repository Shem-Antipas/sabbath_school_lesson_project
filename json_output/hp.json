Therefore\nhe has sought to misrepresent the character of God, to lead men to\ncherish a false conception of Him. The Creator has been presented\nto their minds as clothed with the attributes of the prince of evil\nhimself—as arbitrary, severe, and unforgiving—that He might be\nfeared, shunned, and even hated by men....\nChrist came to reveal God to the world as a God of love, a God\nof mercy, tenderness, and compassion. By the world’s Redeemer the\nthick darkness with which Satan had enshrouded the throne of the\nDeity was swept away, and the Father was again manifest to men as\nthe Light of life....\nChrist is saddened by the sight of men so absorbed in worldly\ncares and business perplexities that they have no time to become\nacquainted with God. To them heaven is a strange place; for they\nhave lost it out of their reckoning. Not familiar with heavenly things,\nthey tire of hearing about them. They dislike to have their minds\ndisturbed in regard to their need of salvation.

Psalm 145:9, 10.\nWe love to contemplate the character and love of God in His\ncreated works. What evidences has He given the children of men\nof His power, as well as of His parental love! He has garnished the\nheavens and made grand and beautiful the earth.\n“O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!\n... When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon\nand the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art\nmindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?” “All thy\nworks praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee” (Psalm\n8:1, 3, 4; Psalm 145:10).\nHad our world been formed with a perfectly level surface the\nmonotony would have fatigued the eye and wearied the senses.

The rugged granite, bare mountains, also the\nmountains decorated with evergreens and verdure, and the valleys\nwiththeirsoftenedbeautymaketheworldamirrorofloveliness. The\ngoodness, wisdom, and power of God are manifest everywhere. In\nmountains, rocks, hills, and valleys, I see the works of divine power.\nI can never be lonely while viewing the grand scenery of nature. On\nthe journey over the plains and mountains I have had feelings of the\ndeepest reverence and awe while viewing the frowning precipice\nand snow-capped mountain heights.\nThe mountains, hills, and valleys should be to us as schools\nin which to study the character of God in His created works. The\nworks of God which we may view in the ever-varying scenes—in\nmountains, hills, and valleys, in trees, shrubs, and flowers, in every\nleaf, every spire of grass—should teach us lessons of the skill and\nlove of God and of His infinite power."

Psalm 40:7, 8.\nIn the councils of heaven it was determined that there must be\ngiven to mankind a living exemplification of the law. Having de-\ncided to make this great sacrifice, God left nothing obscure, nothing\nindefinite, in regard to the salvation of the human race. He gave to\nmankind a standard by which to form character. With an audible\nvoice and in awful grandeur He spoke His law from Mount Sinai.\nDistinctly He stated what we must do in order to render acceptable\nobedience to Him and ... remain loyal to His law. “Thou shalt love\nthe LordthyGodwithallthyheart, andwithallthysoul, andwithall\nthy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second\nis like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these\ntwo commandments hang all the law and the prophets” (Matthew\n22:37-40).\nSo deep was the Lord’s interest in the beings He had created,\nso great His love for the world, that He “gave his only begotten\nSon, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have\neverlasting life” (John 3:16). Christ came to bring moral power to\nman, to elevate, ennoble, and strengthen him, enabling him to be\na partaker of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that\nis in the world through lust. He proved to the inhabitants of the\nunfallen worlds and to human beings that the law can be kept. While\npossessing the nature of man, He obeyed the law of God, vindicating\nGod’s justice in demanding that it be obeyed. In the judgment His\nlife will be an unanswerable argument in favor of God’s law.\nAll who possess the faculty of reason may learn the measure of\ntheir duty. Christ is our pattern. In humanity He lived a spotless life.\nHe was merciful, compassionate, obedient—full of goodness and\ntruth. By His life of obedience He gave a true representation of the\nChristExemplifiedGod’sLaw,February1 81\nlaw. By uniting with Christ, fallen, sinful human beings may con-\nform the life to the divine precepts. By keeping the commandments\nof God, they become laborers together with Him who came to the\nworld to represent the Father by keeping all His commandments."

Prayer has “subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, ob-\ntained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence\nof fire, ... turned to flight the armies of the aliens” (Hebrews 11:33,\n34).\nJesus lived in dependence upon God and communion with Him.\nTo the secret place of the Most High, under the shadow of the\nAlmighty, men now and then repair; they abide for a season, and the\nresult is manifest in noble deeds; then their faith fails, the commu-\nnion is interrupted, and the lifework marred. But the life of Jesus\nwas a life of constant trust, sustained by continual communion; and\nHis service for heaven and earth was without failure or faltering.\nChristian workers can never attain the highest success until they\nlearn the secret of strength. They must give themselves time to think,\nto pray, to wait upon God for a renewal of physical, mental, and\nspiritual power. They need the uplifting of His Spirit. Receiving\nthis, they will be quickened by fresh life. The wearied frame and\ntired brain will be refreshed, the burdened heart will be rested.\nPrayer is the breath of the soul. It is the secret of spiritual power.\nNo other means of grace can be substituted, and the health of the\nsoul be preserved. Prayer brings the heart into immediate contact\nwith the Well-spring of life, and strengthens the sinew and muscle\nof the religious experience.\nFamily prayer and public prayer have their place, but it is secret\ncommunion with God that sustains the soul-life.

You can drive out the enemy with his gloom;\n... and you can see, oh, so much clearer, the love and compassion of\nyour heavenly Father.\nThose who come into sacred relation with the God of heaven are\nnot left to the natural weakness and infirmity of their natures.... The\nworld loses all attraction for them, for they seek a better country, an\neternal world, a life that is to continue through never-ending ages.\nThis is the theme of their thought and conversation. The Word of\nGod becomes exceedingly precious. They discern spiritual things.\nThey rejoice in “that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the\nSongsofPraise,March29 197\ngreat God and our Saviour Jesus Christ” (Titus 2:13). They long to\nsee the King in His beauty, the angels that have never fallen, and the\nland of unfading bloom."

Your temptations, your\nideas, yourfeelings, must all be laid at the foot of the cross. Then the\nsoul is ready to listen to words of divine instruction. Jesus will give\nyou to drink of the water which flows from the river of God.

She realized in a moment that she was made\nwhole, and the Lord Jesus would not let such faith pass unnoticed.\nHe turned Him about quickly and said, “Who touched me?” All\nthe disciples were pressing close around Him, and Peter said, “The\nmultitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched\nme?

        "content": "Christ has shown His great love for us by giving His life that\nwe should not perish in our sins, that He might clothe us with His\nsalvation. If this divine love is cherished in our hearts, it cements\nand strengthens our union with those of like faith. “He that dwelleth\nin love dwelleth in God, and God in him” (1 John 4:16). The\nstrengthening of our love for our brethren and sisters strengthens\nour love for Christ. This principle of love for God and for those\nfor whom Christ died, needs to be quickened by the Holy Spirit\nand cemented with brotherly kindness, tenderness; it needs to be\nstrengthened by acts which testify that God is love. This union,\nwhich joins heart with heart, is not the result of sentimentalism,\nbut the working of a healthful principle. Faith works by love, and\npurifies the soul from all selfishness. Thus the soul is perfected in\nlove. And having found grace and mercy through Christ’s precious\nblood, how can we fail to be tender and merciful? ...\nFaith in Jesus Christ as our personal Saviour, the One who par-\ndons our sins and transgressions, the One who is able to keep us\nfrom sin and lead us in His footsteps, is set forth in the fifty-eighth\nchapter of Isaiah. Here are presented the fruits of a faith that works\nby love and purifies the soul from selfishness. Faith and works are\nhere combined.\n“Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of\nwickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go\nfree, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the\nhungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house?\nwhen thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide\nnot thyself from thine own flesh? Then shall thy light break forth\nas the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy\nHowFaithWorks,April13 229\nrighteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy\nrereward....

Standing at the head of humanity, serving His Father, He is\nan example of what every son should and may be. The obedience\nthat Christ rendered, God requires from human beings today. He\nserved His Father in love, with willingness and freedom. “I delight\nto do thy will, O my God,” He declared: “yea, thy law is within my\nheart” (Psalm 40:8). Christ counted no sacrifice too great, no toil too\nhard, in order to accomplish the work which He came to do. At the\nage of twelve He said, “Wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s\nbusiness?” (Luke 2:49). He had heard the call, and had taken up the\nwork. “My meat,” He said, “is to do the will of him that sent me,\nand to finish his work” (John 4:34).\nThus we are to serve God.

Luke\n6:44.\n“Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith” (2 Corinthians\n13:5). Some conscientious souls, on reading this, immediately begin\nto criticize their every feeling and emotion. But this is not correct\nself-examination. It is not the petty feelings and emotions that are\nto be examined. The life, the character, is to be measured by the\nonly standard of character, God’s holy law. The fruit testifies to the\ncharacter of the tree. Our works, not our feelings, bear witness of us.\nThe feelings, whether encouraging or discouraging, should not\nbe made the test of the spiritual condition. By God’s Word we are to\ndetermine our true standing before Him. Many are bewildered on\nthis point. When they are happy and joyous, they think that they are\naccepted of God. When a change comes, and they feel depressed,\nthey think that God has forsaken them.... God does not desire us to\ngo through life with a distrust of Him.... While we were yet sinners,\nGod gave His Son to die for us. Can we doubt His goodness? ...\nBut a faithful performance of duty goes hand in hand with a right\nestimate of the character of God. There is earnest work to do for the\nMaster. Christ came to preach the gospel to the poor, and He sent\nHis disciples forth to do the same work He came to do. So He sends\nforth His workers today. Sheaves are to be gathered for Him from\nthe highways and hedges.\nThe tremendous issues of eternity demand of us something be-\nsides an imaginary religion, a religion of words and forms, where\nthe truth is kept in the outer court, to be admired as we admire a\nbeautiful flower; they demand something more than a religion of\nfeeling, which distrusts God when trials and difficulties come. Ho-\nliness does not consist in profession, but in lifting the cross, doing\nthe will of God.... “He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his\nObediencetheTestofTrueReligion,May4 273\ncommandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso\nkeepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected” (1 John\n2:4, 5)."

Its aim is\nsuccess in the world, the gratification of selfish ambition. To secure\nthis education many students spend time and money in crowding\ntheir minds with unnecessary knowledge. The world accounts them\nlearned; but God is not in their thoughts....\nThere is another kind of education that is very different. Its\nfundamental principle, as stated by the greatest Teacher the world\nhas ever known, is, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his\nrighteousness” (Matthew 6:33). Its aim is not selfish; its purpose is\nto honor God.... God is the source of all wisdom. He is infinitely\nwise and just and good. Apart from Christ, the wisest men that ever\nlived cannot comprehend Him. They may profess to be wise; they\nmay glory in their attainments; but mere intellectual knowledge,\naside from the great truths that center in Christ, is as nothingness....\nIf men could see for a moment beyond the range of finite vision,\nif they could catch a glimpse of the Eternal, every mouth would be\nstopped in its boasting. Men living in this little atom of a world are\nfinite; God has unnumbered worlds that are obedient to His laws,\nand are conducted with reference to His glory. When men have gone\nas far in scientific research as their limited powers will permit, there\nis still an infinity beyond what they can apprehend.\nBefore men can be truly wise, they mustrealize theirdependence\nupon God, and be filled with His wisdom. God is the source of\nintellectual as well as spiritual power. The greatest men who have\nInTouchwiththeInfinite,May16 297\nreached what the world regards as wonderful heights in science are\nnot to be compared with the beloved John or the apostle Paul. It is\nwhen intellectual and spiritual power are combined that the highest\nstandard of manhood is attained."

        "content": "From eternal ages it was God’s purpose that every created being,\nfrom the bright and holy seraph to man, should be a temple for the\nindwelling of the Creator. Because of sin, humanity ceased to be a\ntemple for God....\nGod designed that the temple at Jerusalem should be a continual\nwitness to the high destiny open to every soul. But the Jews had\nnot understood the significance of the building they regarded with\nso much pride.... The courts of the temple at Jerusalem, filled with\nthe tumult of unholy traffic, represented all too truly the temple of\nthe heart, defiled by the presence of sensual passion and unholy\nthoughts. In cleansing the Temple from the world’s buyers and\nsellers, Jesus announced His mission to cleanse the heart from the\ndefilement of sin—from the earthly desires, the selfish lusts, the\nevil habits that corrupt the soul.... Only Christ can cleanse the soul\ntemple.... His presence will cleanse and sanctify the soul, so that\nit may be a holy temple unto the Lord, and “an habitation of God\nthrough the Spirit” (Ephesians 2:22).\nBy this beautiful and impressive figure God’s Word shows the\nregard He places on our physical organism and the responsibility\nresting upon us to preserve it in the best condition. Our bodies are\nChrist’s purchased possession, and we are not at liberty to do with\nthem as we please. Man has done this. He has treated his body as if\nits laws had no penalty. Through perverted appetite its organs and\npowers have become enfeebled, diseased, crippled....\nWhen men and women are truly converted they will conscien-\ntiously regard the laws of life that God has established in their being,\nthus seeking to avoid physical, mental, and moral feebleness. Obe-\ndience to these laws must be made a matter of personal duty. We\nourselves must suffer the ills of violated law. We must answer to\nTempleforGod,July3 397\nGod for our habits and practices. Therefore the question for us is\nnot, “What will the world say?” but, “How shall I, claiming to be a\nChristian, treat the habitation God has given me?”"

        "content": "Said the psalmist, “I am fearfully and wonderfully made.” God\nhas given us faculties and powers of mind and body, which it is the\nduty of all to preserve in the best condition. If any weaken their\npowers through the indulgence of appetite, they decrease their power\nof influence, making themselves imperfect. Only by the expensive\noffering made upon the cross of Calvary can we understand the\nvalue of the human soul. We are placed on vantage ground by\nthe redeeming power of Jesus Christ, to obtain freedom from the\nbondage of sin which was wrought by the fall of Adam.\nWe are to make the most of the capabilities and talents lent us by\nGod. All who are weakening and destroying the physical, mental,\nand moral powers by sinful eating, sinful dressing, and violation\nof the laws of health in any respect, will have to render an account\nto God for all the good they might have done had they observed\nthe laws of health, rather than being self-indulgent, careless, and\nreckless of the house they live in.... God says, “Ye are not your own.”\nYou are God’s property. Your ransom cost the life of the Son of\nGod.... All are to consider the greatness of the sacrifice made. The\nMajesty of heaven, the King of glory, designs that men and women\nshall give to Him their wholehearted service.\nIn the words of the apostle Paul there is a depth of meaning:\n“I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye\npresent your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,\nwhich is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this\nworld: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that\nye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will\nof God” (Romans 12:1, 2).

But there are\nfew couples who are completely united when the marriage ceremony\nis performed. The form of words spoken over the two who take the\nmarriage vow does not make them a unit. In their future life is to be\nthe blending of the two in wedlock. It may be made a really happy\nunion, if each will give to the other true heart affection.\nBut time strips marriage of the romance with which imagination\nhad clothed it, and then the thought finds entrance into the mind\nthrough Satan’s suggestions, “We do not love each other as we\nsupposed.” Expel it from the mind. Do not linger over it. Let each,\nforgetful of self, refuse to entertain the ideas that Satan would be\nglad to have you cherish.

When the\nromance is gone, let each think, not after a sentimental order, how\nhe or she can make the married life what God would be pleased to\nhave it.\nLife is a precious gift of God and is not to be wasted in selfish\nregrets or more open indifference and dislike. Let the husband and\nwife talk things all over together. Renew the early attentions to each\nother, acknowledge yourfaults to each other, but in this work be very\ncareful that the husband does not take it upon himself to confess his\nwife’s faults or the wife her husband’s. Be determined that you will\nBondsofWedlock,July15 421\nbe all that it is possible for you to be to each other, and the bonds of\nwedlock will be the most desirable of ties.\nYour home may be a symbol of heaven."

It is the means by which those who claim to\nbethechildrenofGodaretestedandtried. WereadthatGodtempted\nAbraham, that He tempted the children of Israel. This means that\nHe permitted circumstances to occur to test their faith and lead them\nto look to Him for help. God permits temptation to come to His\npeople today that they may realize that He is their helper. If they\ndraw nigh to Him when they are tempted, He strengthens them to\nmeet the temptation....\nTemptations will pour in upon us, for by them we are to be tried\nduring our probation. This is the proving of God, the revelation of\nour own hearts. There is no sin in having temptation, but sin comes\nin when temptation is yielded to....\nAbraham certified his obedience to God when, with Isaac by his\nside, he journeyed on his way in response to the command, “Take\nnow thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee\ninto the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering\n...” (Genesis 22:2). Job was permitted to suffer; he was severely\ntempted; but he would not speak one word against God. During\nChrist’s life on earth the scribes and Pharisees, instigated by Satan,\ntempted Him in every possible way. But He never allowed these\ntemptations to lead Him from the path of obedience....\nChrist’s example shows us that our only hope of victory is in\ncontinual resistance of Satan’s attacks. He who triumphed over\nthe adversary of souls in the conflict with temptation understands\nSatan’s power over the race, and has conquered in our behalf. As an\novercomer, He has given us the advantage of His victory, that in our\n“Why”ofTemptation,September1 521\nefforts to resist the temptations of Satan we may unite our weakness\nto His strength, our worthlessness to His merits. And sustained by\nHis enduring might, under strong temptation, we may resist in His\nall-powerful name and overcome as He overcame."

        "content": "Christianity promises no exemption from sorrow. “We must\nthrough much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God” (Acts\n14:22). Faith is needed, strong, trusting faith, which believes that\nGod will bring His children into no temptation greater than they\nare able to bear. What such faith has power to do is told by Paul\nin his letter to the Hebrews. Speaking of those who in the face of\npersecution and death had maintained an unshaken trust in God, he\nsays:\n“Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness,\nobtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the vio-\nlence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were\nmade strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of\nthe aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again: and oth-\ners were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain\na better resurrection: and others had trial of cruel mockings and\nscourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: they were\nstoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the\nsword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being\ndestitute, afflicted, tormented” (Hebrews 11:33-37).\nIn this world these heroes of faith were counted unworthy of\nlife; but in heaven they are enrolled as sons of God, worthy of the\nhighest honor. “They shall walk with me in white,” Christ declares:\n“for they are worthy” (Revelation 3:4). In the courts of heaven there\nawaits them an “eternal weight of glory.” “Wherefore seeing we also\nare compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay\naside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and\nlet us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto\nJesus the author and finisher of our faith” (Hebrews 12:1). “Our\nNoExemptionfromSorrow,September18 555\nlight affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more\nexceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the\nthings which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the\nthings which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not\nseen are eternal” (2 Corinthians 4:17, 18)."

It is\na love stronger than death, for He died for us. It is a love more\ntrue than that of a mother for her children. The mother’s love may\nchange, but Christ’s love is changeless. “I am persuaded,” Paul\nsays, “that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor\npowers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth,\nnor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of\nGod, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 8:38, 39).\nIn every trial we have strong consolation.

This grace had moved upon the heart of Cornelius. The\nSpirit of Christ had spoken to his soul; Jesus had drawn him, and he\nhad yielded to the drawing. His prayer and alms were not urged or\nextorted from him; they were not a price he was seeking to pay in\norder to secure heaven, but they were the fruit of love and gratitude\nto God.\nSuch prayer from a sincere heart ascends as incense before the\nLord; and offerings to His cause and gifts to the needy and suffering\nare a sacrifice well pleasing to Him. Thus the gifts of the Philippian\nbrethren, who ministered to the needs of the apostle Paul while\na prisoner at Rome, are said to be “an odour of a sweet smell, a\nsacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God” (Philippians 4:18).\nPrayer and almsgiving are closely linked together—the expres-\nsion of love to God and to our fellow men. They are the outworking\nof the two great principles of the divine law, “Thou shalt love the\nLord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with\nall thy mind, and with all thy strength“: and “Thou shalt love thy\nneighbour as thyself” (Mark 12:30, 31).

He who learns in the school of Christ will know how to pray\nand how to speak for the Master. Realizing that he lacks wisdom\nand experience, he will place himself under the training of the Great\nTeacher, knowing that only thus he can obtain perfection in God’s\nEveryManOurNeighbor,November9 663\nservice.

The time of trouble is about to come upon the\npeople of God. Then it is that the decree will go forth forbidding\nthosewhokeeptheSabbathoftheLordtobuyorsell,andthreatening\nthem with punishment, and even death, if they do not observe the\nfirst day of the week as the Sabbath.\n“And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which\nstandeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time\nof trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that\nsame time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every\none that shall be found written in the book” (Daniel 12:1). By this\nwe see the importance of having our names written in the book of\nlife. All whose names are registered there will be delivered from\nSatan’s power, and Christ will command that their filthy garments\nbe removed, and that they be clothed with His righteousness. “And\nthey shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make\nup my jewels ...” (Malachi 3:17).\nIn the time of trouble Satan stirs up the wicked, and they encircle\nthe people of God to destroy them. But he does not know that\n“pardon” has been written opposite their names in the books of\nheaven. He does not know that the command has been given, “Take\nTimeofTrouble,December3 713\naway the filthy garments” from them, clothe them with “change of\nraiment,” and set “a fair miter” upon their heads (Zechariah 3:4, 5)....\nHow precious in the sight of God are His people!"

His love\nwill call forth a response from them, and their lives will show to\nthose around them that the Spirit of God is controlling them, that\nthey are setting their affections on things above, not on the things of\nthe earth.\nIn thinking of heaven, we may put our imagination to the utmost\nstretchandthinkthe loftiestthoughts thatwe are capable ofthinking,\nand our minds will grow weary in the effort to comprehend the\nbreadth and depth and height of the subject. It is impossible for our\nminds to take in the great themes of eternity. It is impossible for\nus even to make an effort to understand these things without the\neffort affecting our whole character for good and having an uplifting\ninfluence on our minds. As we think of how Christ came to our\nworld to die for fallen man, we understand something of the price\nthat was paid for our redemption, and we realize that there is no true\ngoodness or greatness apart from God.\nOnly by the light shining from the cross of Calvary can we know\nto what depths of sin and degradation the human race has fallen\nthrough sin. Only by the length of the chain let down from heaven to\ndraw us up can we know the depths to which we had sunk.
