All our lack will be supplied. Who will\nseek at the beginning of this new year to obtain a new and genuine\nexperience in the things of God? Make your wrongs right as far\nas possible. Confess your errors and sins to one another. Let all\nbitterness and wrath and malice be put away. Let patience, long-\nsuffering, kindness, and love become a part of your very being; then\nwhatsoever things are pure and lovely and of good report will mature\nin your experience....\nIt behooves us individually to cultivate the grace of Christ, to\nbe meek and lowly of heart, to be firm, unwavering, steadfast in the\ntruth; for thus only can we advance in holiness and be made fit for\nthe inheritance of the saints in light. Let us begin the year with an\nentire renunciation of self. Let us pray for clear discernment,... that\nwe may always and everywhere be witnesses for Christ.\nOur time and talents belong to God, to be used for His honor and\nglory. It should be our earnest, anxious effort to let the light shine\nthrough our life and character to illumine the pathway heavenward,\nthat souls may be attracted from the broad road to the narrow way\nof holiness....\nOldYearandtheNew,January1 31\nStrong men and women are needed in the church, successful\nworkers in the Lord’s vineyard, men and women who will labor\nthat the church may be transformed to the image of Christ rather\nthan conformed to the customs and practices of the world.

He was\noften to be found in earnest prayer, in the grove, by the lakeside,\nand in the mountains. He has enjoined upon us to watch and pray.\nIt is the neglect of watchfulness and close searching of heart that\nleads to self-sufficiency and spiritual pride. Without a deep sense of\nour need of help from God, there will be but little earnest, heartfelt\nprayer for divine aid....\nUnceasing watchfulness is a great help to prayer.... The one\nwhose mind loves to dwell upon God has a strong defense. Such a\none will be quick to perceive the dangers that threaten the spiritual\nlife, and a sense of danger will lead that person to call upon God for\nhelp and protection.\nThere are times when the Christian life seems beset by dangers,\nand duty seems hard to perform. But the clouds that gather about our\nway, and the perils that surround us, will never disappear before a\nhalting, doubting, prayerless spirit. At such times unbelief says, We\ncan never surmount these obstructions; let us wait until we can see\nour way clearly.” But faith courageously urges an advance, hoping\nall things, believing all things....\nThe prayer may well be offered daily by those who have the\nfear of God before them, that He will preserve their hearts from evil\ndesires, and strengthen their souls to resist temptation....\nWatchandPray,January2 33\nThe Word of God exhorts us to be found “praying always with\nall prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto\nwith all perseverance”; and again, “Be ye therefore sober, and watch\nunto prayer.” Here is the Christians’ safeguard, their protection amid\nthe perils that surround their pathway.—The Review and Herald,"

The understanding adapts itself to the dimensions of\nthe subjects with which it is required to deal. If occupied with trivial,\ncommonplace matters only, never summoned to earnest effort to\ncomprehend great and eternal truths, it becomes dwarfed and enfee-\nbled. Hence the value of the Scriptures as a means of intellectual\nculture. Their perusal in a reverent and teachable spirit will expand\nand strengthen the mind as no other study can. They lead directly to\nthe contemplation of the most exalted, the most ennobling, and the\nmost stupendous truths that are presented to the human mind.

And he prayed again, and the\nheaven gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit. James 5:17,\n18.\nImportant lessons are presented to us in the experience of Elijah.\nWhen upon Mount Carmel he offered the prayer for rain, his faith\nwas tested, but he persevered in making known his request unto God.\nSix times he prayed earnestly, and yet there was no sign that his\npetition was granted, but with strong faith he urged his plea to the\nthrone of grace. Had he given up in discouragement at the sixth time,\nhis prayer would not have been answered.... We have a God whose\near is not closed to our petitions; and if we prove His word, He will\nhonor our faith. He wants us to have all our interests interwoven\nwith His interests, and then He can safely bless us; for we shall not\nthen take glory to self when the blessing is ours, but shall render all\nthe praise to God.\nGod does not always answer our prayers the first time we call\nupon Him; for should He do this, we might take it for granted that\nwe had a right to all the blessings and favors He bestowed upon us.\nInstead of searching our hearts to see if any evil was entertained by\nus, any sin indulged, we would become careless, and fail to realize\nour dependence upon Him, and our need of His help.\nElijah humbled himself until he was in a condition where he\nwould not take the glory to himself. This is the condition upon\nwhich the Lord hears prayer; for then we shall give the praise to\nHim....\nWe are to believe the Word of God whether we have any mani-\nfestation of feeling or not.

They were deeply impressed by His prayer, for it\nwas charged with vital power that reached their hearts. It was very\nunlike the prayers which they themselves had offered, and unlike\nany prayers which they had heard from human lips. After Jesus had\njoined them again, they said to Him: “Lord, teach us to pray, as John\nalso taught his disciples.”...\nIt means much to pray to our Heavenly Father. We come to lay\nour imperfect tribute of thanksgiving at His feet in acknowledgment\nof His love and mercy, of which we are wholly undeserving. We\ncome to make known our wants, to confess our sins, and to present\nto Him His own promises....\nJesus has given to us a prayer in which every expression is full\nof meaning, to be studied and brought into practical life....

        "content": "There are two kinds of prayer-the prayer of form and the prayer\nof faith. The repetition of set, customary phrases when the heart\nfeels no need of God, is formal prayer.... We should be extremely\ncareful in all our prayers to speak the wants of the heart and to say\nonly what we mean. All the flowery words at our command are\nnot equivalent to one holy desire. The most eloquent prayers are\nbut vain repetitions if they do not express the true sentiments of\nthe heart. But the prayer that comes from an earnest heart, when\nthe simple wants of the soul are expressed just as we would ask an\nearthly friend for a favor, expecting that it would be granted-this is\nthe prayer of faith. The publican who went up to the temple to pray\nis a good example of a sincere, devoted worshipper. He felt that\nhe was a sinner, and his great need led to an outburst of passionate\ndesire, “God be merciful to me a sinner.”...\nTo commune with God we must have something to say to Him\nconcerning our actual life. The long, black catalogue of our delin-\nquencies is before the eye of the Infinite. The register is complete;\nnone ofouroffenses are forgotten. ButHe who wroughtwonderfully\nfor His servants of old will listen to the prayer of faith and pardon\nour transgressions. He has promised, and He will fulfill His word....\nAfter we have offered our petitions, we are to answer them\nourselves as far as possible, and not wait for God to do for us what\nwe can do for ourselves.... Divine help is to be combined with\nhuman effort, aspiration, and energy.... We cannot be borne up by\nthe prayers of others when we ourselves neglect to pray, for God\nhas made no such provision for us. Not even divine power can lift\none soul to heaven that is unwilling to put forth efforts in his own\nbehalf....\nPrayersofFormandPrayersofFaith,January11 51\nAs thus step by step we ascend the shining ladder that leads to\nthe city of God, oh how many times we shall be discouraged and\ncome to weep at the feet of Jesus over our failures and our defeats....\nYet let us not cease our efforts. Heaven can be attained by every one\nof us if we will strive lawfully, doing the will of Jesus and growing\ninto His image. Temporary failure should make us lean more heavily\non Christ, and we should press on with brave heart, determined will,"

This religion teaches us to exercise patience and\nlong-suffering when brought into places where we receive treatment\nthat is hard and unjust....\nBut if the word of God is made an abiding principle in our lives,\neverything with which we have to do, each word, each trivial act,\nwill reveal that we are subject to Jesus Christ, that even our thoughts\nhave been brought into captivity to Him. If the word of God is\nreceived into the heart, it will empty the soul of self-sufficiency and\nself-dependence. Our lives will be a power for good, because the\nHoly Spiritwillfillourminds withthe things ofGod. The religion of\nChrist will be practiced by us, for our wills are in perfect conformity\nto the will of God....\n“Search the scriptures.” No other book will give you such pure,\nelevating, ennobling thoughts; from no other book can you obtain\na deep religious experience. When you devote time to self-exami-\nnation, to humble prayer, to earnest study of God’s Word, the Holy\nSpirit is near to apply the truth to your heart....\nThe Bible, and the Bible alone, is to be the rule of our faith. It is\na leaf from the tree of life, and by eating it, by receiving it into our\nminds, we shall grow strong to do the will of God....\nIf we do not receive the religion of Christ by feeding upon the\nWord of God, we shall not be entitled to an entrance into the city of\nGod. Having lived on earthly food, having educated our tastes to\nlove worldly things,... we could not appreciate the pure, heavenly\ncurrent that circulates in heaven....\nBibleReligionIsPractical,January12 53\nJesus says, “Without me ye can do nothing.” Living in Christ,\nadhering to Christ, supported by Christ, drawing nourishment from\nChrist, we bear fruit after the similitude of Christ. We live and move\nin Him; we are one with Him and one with the Father. The name\nof Christ is glorified in the believing child of God. This is Bible"

Says the\ngreat apostle, “Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and\nthough I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth\nme nothing.”...\nIt is to cultivate a spirit of benevolence in us that the Lord calls\nfor our gifts and offerings. He is not dependent upon us for means\nto sustain His cause. He declares by the prophet, “Every beast of the\nforest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.”...\nGod might have made angels the ambassadors of His truth. He\nmight have made known His will, as He proclaimed the law from\nSinai, with His own voice. But He has chosen to employ men\nand women to do this work. And it is only as we fulfill the divine\npurpose in our creation that life can be a blessing to us. All the\nriches intrusted to us will prove only a curse unless we employ them\nto relieve our own daily wants and the wants of the needy around us,\nand to glorify God by advancing His cause in the earth.\nThe Majesty of heaven yielded up His high command, His glory\nwith the Father, and even His own life to save us. And now what will\nwe do for Him? God forbid that His professed children should live\nfor themselves!... The first and best of everything rightfully belongs\nto Him.... It is in this life that He requires all our talents to be put\nout to the exchangers....\nWe should not look upon the tithe as the limit of our liberality.\nThe Jews were required to bring to God numerous offerings besides\nthe tithe; and shall not we, who enjoy the blessings of the gospel,\ndo as much to sustain God’s cause as was done in the former, less-\nfavored dispensation? As the work for this time is extending in the\nearth, the calls for help are constantly increasing....\nSteward’sDuty,January21 71\nNot till we wish the infinite Father to cease bestowing His gifts\non us should we impatiently exclaim, Is there no end of giving?\nNot only should we faithfully render to God our tithes, which He\nclaims as His own, but we should bring a tribute to His treasury as an\noffering of gratitude. Let us with joyful hearts bring to our Creator\nthe firstfruits of all His bounties-our choicest possessions, our best"

In Him was no guile or\nsinfulness; He was ever pure and undefiled; yet He took upon Him\nour sinful nature.

His whole history for more than thirty years was of pure,\ndisinterested benevolence.\nCan we wonder that those who heard Him were astonished at\nHis teaching? “He taught them as one having authority, and not as\nthe scribes.” The teaching of the scribes and the Pharisees was a\ncontinuous repetition of fables and childish traditions. Their opin-\nions and ceremonies rested on the authority of ancient maxims and\nrabbinical sayings, which were frivolous and worthless.

As one\npossessing higher authority He addressed His hearers, presenting\nbefore them momentous subjects, and His appeals carried conviction\nto their hearts.

His\nheart of love is touched by our sorrows, and even by our utterance\nof them.... Nothing is too great for Him to bear, for He holds up\nworlds, He rules over the affairs of the universe.

Thou knowest how Thou hast\npresented this matter to Thy servant....\nHere are Thy ministers, whose work it is to proclaim Bible truth.\nI ask Thee that they may have a clear realization of the responsibili-\nties thatrestupon them as guardians andas shepherds ofThy flock....\nLet them understand their own weakness, and may the sanctification\nof the Spirit come to them....\nHere are those who bear responsibilities in our institutions....\nThey have not in their dealings given a right example to the world.\nThey did not realize that others were taking knowledge of them, to\nsee whether they were sanctified by the truth.\nOh, pardon our transgressions and forgive our sins! Show us\nwhere we have come short. Let Thy Holy Spirit descend upon us.\nThe world is perishing in sin, and we ask Thee to roll the burden\nupon us at this meeting....\nThou hast opened these things before me, and Thou alone canst\nprepare minds and hearts to hear the message that unless those who\nhave left their first love shall return to recognize the work that needs\nto be done in their individual hearts, Thou wilt come quickly and\nremove the candlestick out of his place....\nPropheticMessengerPrays,January31 91\nWe must be reconverted, sanctified, and made fit to bear the\nmessage of the Lord....\nMy Father, break down the barriers, that confessions may be\nmade, from heart To Whom It May Concern: heart, from brother to\nbrother.

When we talk of self-denial and sacrifice for Christ’s sake,\nthey think we dwell too much on these points. You would prefer to\nhear us speak of the Christian’s reward. We know that those who\nare faithful will inherit all things, but the great question with us\nshould be, “Who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall\nstand when he appeareth?” Who shall be counted worthy to receive\nthe exceeding great and precious reward that shall be given to the\novercomers? Those who shall be partakers of Christ’s sufferings\nwill be sharers with Him of His glory.\nWithout holiness, the Word of God tells us, no one can see the\nLord. Without purity of life it is impossible for us to be fitted and\nprepared to dwell with the holy and sinless angels in a pure and holy\nheaven. No sin can be there. No impurity can enter the pearly gates\nofthe golden cityofGod. Andthe question forus to settle is whether\nwe will turn from all sin and comply with the conditions God has\ngiven us, that we may become His sons and daughters. Separation\nfrom the world He requires of us in order to become members of the\nroyal family....\nWe believe without a doubt that Christ is soon to come, and\nbelieving this we feel a necessity upon us to plead with men and\nwomen to prepare for the coming of the Son of man.... We want you\nto be of that company that shall bow before the throne of God crying,\n“Worthy, worthy, worthy, is the Lamb that was slain for us.”...\nWhen you are all ready, having overcome your sins, having put\naway all your iniquity from you, you are in a condition to receive\nthe finishing touch of immortality....\nHolinessintheLord,February1 95\nIt will not be safe for you to wait for a better time to come. It\nis while it is called today. If anyone will hear His voice, harden\nnot your hearts. It is to listen today to the invitation of mercy. It\nis to yield your pride, your folly, your vanity, and make an entire\nsurrender of your heart to God.

No; self-denial is an\nessential condition of discipleship....\nChrist, as our head, led out in the great work of salvation, but\nHe has entrusted that work to His followers upon earth. It cannot\nbe carried on without means, and He has given His people a plan\nfor raising means sufficient to make His cause prosperous. The\ntithing system, instituted for this purpose, reaches back to the time\nof Moses. Even as far back as the days of Adam, long before the\ndefinite system was given, men were required to offer to God gifts\nfor religious purposes....\nGod does not compel us to give to His cause. Our action must be\nvoluntary. He will not have His treasury replenished with unwilling\nofferings. His design in the plan of systematic giving was to bring\nus into close relationship with our Creator and in sympathy and love\nwith our fellow human beings, thus placing upon us responsibili-\nties that would counteract selfishness and strengthen disinterested,\ngenerous impulses. We are inclined to be selfish and to close our\nhearts to generous deeds. The Lord, by requiring gifts to be made\nat stated times, designed that giving should become a habit and be\nlooked upon as a Christian duty. The heart, opened by one gift, was\nGiving,aHabitBornofLove,February10 113\nnot to have time to close and become selfishly cold, before another\noffering was bestowed....\nEvery man, woman, and child may become a treasurer for the\nLord....\nIt is for our own good that He has planned to have us bear some\npart in the advancement of His cause. He has honored us by making\nus coworkers with Himself. He has ordained that there should\nbe a necessity for the cooperation of His people, that they may\ncultivate and keep in exercise their benevolent affections.—Signs of\nthe Times, March. 18, 1886."

        "content": "If we could appreciate this great blessing, what an advantage it\nwould be to us! We are given the privilege of being laborers together\nwith God in the saving of our souls. Receiving and believing is our\npart of the contract. We are to receive Christ as our personal Savior,\nand are to continue to believe in Him. This means abiding in Christ,\nshowing in Him, at all times and under all circumstances, a faith that\nis a representation of His character-a faith that works by love, and\npurifies the soul from all defilement....\nWe must each obtain an experience for ourselves.

None of us need to excuse\nour hasty temper, our misshapen character, our selfishness, envy,\njealousy, or any impurity of soul, body, or spirit. God has called us\nto glory and virtue.

How can we dis-\ncern his false theories and resist his temptations? Only through\nthe individual experience gained by receiving a knowledge of Jesus\nChrist our Lord. Without divine aid we could not possibly escape\nthe temptations and snares that Satan has prepared to deceive human\nminds....\nWe are to walk as He walked, following closely in His footsteps,\nmanifesting His meekness and lowliness.... The service of Christ is\npure and elevated. The path He traveled is not one of self-pleasing,\nself-gratification. He speaks to His children, saying, “If any man\nBecomingaChildofGod,February21 135\nwill come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross,\nand follow me.” The price of heaven is submission to Christ. The\nway to heaven is obedience to the command, Deny thyself, take up\nthy cross, and follow Me.

        "content": "These words of the Savior are deeply significant and call for our\nearnest study.... Many who possess great wealth have obtained their\nriches by close dealing, by benefiting themselves at the expense of\ntheir fellow human beings; and they glory in their shrewdness in\nclosing a bargain. Every dollar thus obtained, and the increase of\nevery such dollar, has upon it the curse of God....\nWealthy men and women are to be more closely tested than they\nhave ever yet been. If they stand the test, and remove the blemishes\nof dishonesty and injustice from their characters, and as faithful\nstewards render to God the things that are God’s, to them it will be\nsaid, “Well done, thou good and faithful servant:... enter thou into\nthe joy of thy Lord.”...\n“No man can serve two masters,” Christ said, “for either he will\nhate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and\ndespise the other.”... When the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard\nthese things, they derided Him. But turning to them, Christ said, “Ye\nare they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your\nhearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination\nin the sight of God.”...\nWriting to his son in the gospel, Paul says, “Godliness with\ncontentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world,\nand it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and\nraiment let us be therewith content. But they that will be rich fall\ninto temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts,\nwhich drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of\nmoney is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they\nhave erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many\nsorrows.”...\nGodlinessWithContentment,February22 137\nPaul would impress upon the mind of Timothy the necessity\nof giving such instruction as would remove the deception which\nso easily steals upon the rich, that because of their wealth they\nare superior to others who do not have such large possessions as\nthemselves. They suppose their gain to be godliness....\nThere are high and holy interests which call for our money, and\nthe money invested in these will yield to the giver more elevated\nand permanent enjoyment than if it were expended for personal\ngratification or selfishly hoarded for greed of gain.—The Review"

The enemy of God and humanity is not willing\nthat this truth should be clearly presented, for he knows that if the\npeople receive it fully, his power will be broken. If he can control\nminds, so that doubt and unbelief and darkness shall compose the\nexperience of those who claim to be the children of God, he can\novercome them with temptation. The simple faith that takes God\nat His word should be encouraged. God’s people must have that\nfaith which will lay hold of divine power; “for by grace are ye saved\nthrough faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God.” Those\nwho believe that God for Christ’s sake has forgiven their sins should\nnot, through temptation, fail to press on to fight the good fight of\nfaith. Their faith should grow stronger until their Christian life, as\nwell as their words, shall declare, “The blood of Jesus Christ his Son\ncleanseth us from all sin.”\nFaith is trusting God-believing that He loves us and knows best\nwhat is for our good. Thus instead of our own way, it leads us to\nchoose His way. In place of our ignorance, it accepts His wisdom; in\nplace of our weakness, His strength; in place of our sinfulness, His\nrighteousness. Our lives, ourselves, are already His; faith acknowl-\nedges His ownership and accepts its blessing. Truth, uprightness,\npurity, have been pointed out as secrets of life’s success....

Many\nof the events of human history have been linked with sacred song.\nThe history of the songs of the Bible is full of suggestion as to\nthe uses and benefits of music and song. Music is often perverted to\nserve purposes of evil, and it thus becomes one of the most alluring\nagencies of temptation. But rightly employed, it is a precious gift\nof God, designed to uplift the thoughts to high and noble themes, to\ninspire and elevate the soul. As the children of Israel, journeying\nthrough the wilderness, cheered their way by the music of sacred\nsong, so God bids His children today gladden their pilgrim life.\nThere are few means more effective for fixing His Word in the\nmemory than repeating them in song. And such song has wonderful\npower. It has power to subdue rude and uncultivated natures, power\nto quicken thought and to awaken sympathy, to promote harmony of\naction, and to banish the gloom and foreboding that destroy courage\nand weaken effort.\nIt is one of the most effective means of impressing the heart\nwith spiritual truth.

The song of the angels is in harmony with the\nwords of the prophet Isaiah, who, when he predicted the birth of\nChrist, declared Him to be the Prince of peace. The gospel is a glori-\nous message of peace and goodwill to men; the blessing that Christ\ncame to bring was that of harmony and peace. He left His throne of\nglory, and clothed His divinity with humanity, that He might bring\nback from apostasy to loyalty to God the children of men, and bind\ntheir hearts together and to the heart of Infinite Love. He came\nto present to a fallen world the remedy for sin, so that whosoever\nshould believe on Him should not perish, but by becoming one with\nHim and the Father should have everlasting life....\nThe condition of the world at the time when Christ came into\nthe walks of humanity was no exceptional condition.

They\nwould rather yield the truth than sell and give to the poor. Here they\nare proved to see how much God is loved, how much the truth is\nloved, and like the young man in the Bible, many go away sorrowful,\nbecause they cannot have their riches and a treasure in heaven too....\nThe love of Jesus and riches cannot dwell in the same heart....\nI saw that God could send means from heaven to carry on His\nwork; but this is out of His order. He has ordained that men and\nwomen should be His instruments, that as a great sacrifice was made\nto redeem them, they should act a part in this work of salvation\nby making a sacrifice for each other, and by thus doing show how\nhighly they prize the sacrifice that has been made for them....\nI have seen that some give of their abundance, but yet they feel\nno lack.

Some there are who, notwithstanding\nthey greatly desire wealth, would be ruined by its possession. God\nhas tested individuals by lending them talents of means. It was in\ntheir power to abuse the gift or use it to the glory of God.... They\nhave been tested and proved and found unfaithful in using that which\nwas another’s as though it was their own.

At the harvest and the vintage,\nthe firstfruits of the fields-corn, wine, and oil-were to be consecrated\nas an offering to the Lord. The gleanings and the corners of the\nfields were reserved forthe poor. The firstfruits of the wool when the\nsheep were shorn, of the grain when the wheat was threshed, were\nto be offered to the Lord; and at the feast it was commanded that the\npoor, the widows, the orphans, and the strangers should be invited.\nAt the close of every year all were required to make solemn oath\nwhether or not they had done according to the command of God.\nThis arrangement was made by the Lord to impress upon the\npeople that in every matter He must be first. They were, by this\nsystem of benevolence, reminded that their gracious Master was\nthe true proprietor of their fields, their flocks, and their herds, that\nthe God of heaven sent them sunshine and rain for their seed-time\nand harvest, and that everything which they possessed was of His\ncreation. All was the Lord’s, and He had made them stewards of His\ngoods.\nThe liberality of the Jews in the construction of the taberna-\ncle evinced a spirit of benevolence which has not been equaled by\nthe people of God at any later date. The Hebrews had just been\nfreed from their long bondage in Egypt, they were wanderers in the\nwilderness; yet scarcely were they delivered from the armies of the\nEgyptians who pursued them in their hasty journey, when the word\nof the Lord came to Moses, “Speak unto the children of Israel, that\nthey bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with\nhis heart ye shall take my offering.”...\nLiberalityandLoveforGod’sWork,March5 161\nAll gave with a willing hand, not a certain amount of their in-\ncrease, but a large portion of their actual possessions.

Had He not given them all that they possessed?\nIf He called for it, was it not their duty to give back to the lender\nHis own? No urging was needed.

The people did not give reluctantly; they rejoiced in the\nprospect of a building being erected for the worship of God. They\ndonated more than enough for the purpose. David blessed the Lord\nbefore all the congregation, and said, “But who am I, and what is my\npeople, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort?\nfor all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.”...\nDavid well understood from whom came all his bounties.

They make a will donating a large sum to the church and\nits various interests, and then settle down with a feeling that they\nhave done all that is required of them. Wherein have they denied self\nby this act? They have, on the contrary, exhibited only selfishness.\nWhen they have no further use for their money, they propose to\ngive it to God. But they will retain it as long as they can, till they\nare compelled to relinquish it by a messenger that cannot be turned\ndown.\nJoyofAdvancingGod’sWork,March6 163\nGod has made us all His stewards, and in no case authorized us\nto neglect our duty or leave it for others to do. The call for means to\nadvance the cause of truth will never be more urgent than now. Our\nmoney will never do a greater amount of good than at the present\ntime.... If we leave others to accomplish that which God has left for\nas to do, we wrong ourselves and Him who gave us all we have....\nGod would have all be executors of their own will in this matter,"

There was a famine in Jerusalem, and the\ndisciples, “every man according to his ability, determined to send\nrelief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea.” They presented the\nneed to the churches, expecting to receive a small sum for the relief\nof the needy saints; and in prayer they presented before the Lord the\nnecessity.\nBut the Macedonian believers, moved by the Spirit of God, first\nmade an entire consecration of themselves to God, and then gave all\nthat they had. They felt it a privilege thus to give expression to their\ntrust in God. The Macedonian believers were poor, but they did not\nhave to be urged to give. They rejoiced that they had opportunity\nto contribute of their means.

And when the apostles would have\nrestrained them, they pleaded with them to receive the contribution\nand carry it to the afflicted saints.\nThis self-denial and self-sacrifice far exceeded Paul’s expecta-\ntions, and he was filled with thanksgiving; and taking courage by\nExampleofLiberality,March14 179\nthis example, by epistle he exhorted Titus to stir up the church in\nCorinth to the same good works....\n“We desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish\nin you the same grace also.

De-\nspite all the privileges and opportunities granted them, they brought\nforth only briers and thorns-no fruit to the glory of God. This\nblighted tree was a parable to the house of Israel-a most impressive\nlesson. It is also a lesson to the professed followers of Christ in\nevery age. Reaching through all time, it speaks in unmistakable\nlanguage to all formalists and boasters of godliness who stand forth\nto the world with high profession but are utterly devoid of that vital\npiety which alone God recognizes as fruit....\nLike the barren fig tree, many flaunt their foliage-covered\nbranches before the Lord, proudly claiming to be His command-\nment-keeping people, while the heart-searching God finds them\ndestitute of fruit....\nWe learn from the Sacred Record that this tree, upon which hung\nnot a redeeming cluster of fruit, was clothed with green foliage.\nNotice the words, “Having a form of godliness, but denying the\npower thereof.” The doom of the fruitless fig tree has an application\nto individual professors who manifest the natural tendencies of the\nunrenewed heart, and contradict their faith by their daily life. They\ndo not represent to the world the character of Christ, because they\nhave not Christ in them.\nOur Savior never turned away from the truly penitent, no matter\nhow great their guilt. But He hates all hypocrisy and vain display....\nFruitless professors, sad indeed is your fate; for the open sinner\nstands in a more favorable position in the sight of God. The blight of\nGod’s curse is upon that class who hide the deformity of their lives\nunder a profession of godliness. John, that bold, undaunted reprover\nBarrenFigTree,April3 221\nof sin, who came to prepare the way for Christ’s first advent, thus\naddressed the multitude that flocked to hear him: “Therefore every\ntree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into\nI still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear\nthem now.

John 16:12, 13.\nThe Lord Jesus had precious truth to open before His disciples,\nbutHecouldnotunfoldittotheirmindsuntiltheywereinacondition\nto comprehend the significance of what He desired to teach....\nThough He unfolded great and wonderful things to the minds of\nHis disciples, He left many things unsaid that could not be compre-\nhended by them. At His last meeting with them before His death,\nHe said, “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear\nthem now.”... Earthly ideas, temporal things, occupied so large a\nplace in their minds, that they could not then understand the exalted\nnature, the holy character, of His kingdom, though He laid it out in\nclear lines before them. It was because of their former erroneous\ninterpretation of the prophecies, because of human customs and\ntraditions, presented and urged upon them by the priests, that their\nminds had become confused and were hardened to truth.\nWhat was it that Jesus withheld because they could not compre-\nhendit? Itwas the more spiritual, glorious truths concerning the plan\nof redemption. The words of Christ, which the Comforter would\nrecall to their minds after His ascension, led them to more careful\nthought and earnest prayer that they might comprehend His words\nand give them to the world. Only the Holy Spirit could enable them\nto appreciate the significance of the plan of redemption. The lessons\nof Christ, coming to the world through the inspired testimony of the\ndisciples, have a significance and value far beyond that which the\ncasual reader of the Scriptures gives them. Christ sought to make\nplain His lessons by means of illustrations and parables. He spoke\nof the truths of the Bible as a treasure hid in a field, which, when\na man had found, he went and sold all that he had, and bought the\nfield. He represents the gems of truth, not as lying directly upon the\nIHaveManyThingstoSayUntoYou,April4 223\nsurface, but as buried deep in the ground; as hidden treasures that\nmust be searched for. We must dig for the precious jewels of truth,\nas a man would dig in a mine.\nIn presenting the truth to others, we should follow the example"

They are not able to change\ntheir own hearts, but the Holy Spirit, through their obedience to the\ntruth, sanctifies the soul.\nThe good heart does not mean a heart without sin, for the gospel\nis to be preached to the lost. Jesus says, “I came not to call the righ-\nteous, but sinners to repentance.” Convicted sinners see themselves\nas transgressors in the great moral mirror, God’s holy law. They\nlook upon the Savior upon the cross of Calvary and ask why this\ngreat sacrifice was made; and the cross points to the holy law of\nGod, which has been transgressed. It was to save the transgressor\nfrom ruin that He who was coequal with God offered up His life\non Calvary.... The law has no power to pardon the evil-doer; but\nJesus has taken the sins of the transgressor upon Himself, and as\na sinner exercises faith in Him as the sacrifice, Christ imputes His\nown righteousness to the guilty one.

If we under-\ntake this warfare in our own wisdom, our human ability, we shall\ncertainly be overcome; but if we exercise living faith in Jesus, and\npractice godliness, we shall understand what it means to be sancti-\nGood-groundHearers,April8 231\nfied through the truth, and we shall not be overcome in the conflict,\nfor heavenly angels encamp around about us.

Is it because Jesus failed us and\ndid not supply us with His grace? No; it is because we did not do\nwhat the Lord has told us to do, “Watch unto prayer”; “Pray always”;\n“Pray without ceasing.”\nHow can your soul be in health when you shut yourself away\nfrom prayer and have no connection with Christ, the source of all\nspiritual light and life and power? We must have a constant connec-\ntion with Christ, for He is our sustenance. He is that bread which\ncame down from heaven. Then let us be doers of His word, and\nwe shall have spiritual life and power. We must place ourselves\noften before God as suppliants, because prayer brings the soul into\nimmediate contact with God through Jesus Christ. He is the Way,\nthe Truth, and the Life. If Christians fail, it is because they do not\nobey the orders of their Captain. They are off guard; they are not\nChristlike. It will work disaster to the soul to neglect prayer, for you\nwill be led to yield carelessly to temptation. But if you do yield, do\nnot therefore cast away your confidence in God; lose confidence in\nyourself, and press closer to the side of Christ.\nChrist is not to be charged with the results of the negligence and\nindecision. He who gave His life to save fallen men and women\nappreciates the value of the soul. He will never fail of doing His\npart nor become discouraged. He will never leave the erring one,\ntempted and tried in the conflict. “My grace is sufficient for thee.”\n“God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye\nare able.” He weighs and measures every trial before He permits it\nto come....\nOppositionMayBenefitUs,April9 233\nThe opposition we meet may prove a benefit to us in many ways.\nIf it is well borne, it will develop virtues which would never have\nappeared if the Christian had nothing to endure. And faith, patience,\nforbearance, heavenly mindedness, trust in Providence, and genuine\nsympathy with the erring, are the results of trial well borne....\nIf the word is received into good and honest hearts, the stubborn\nsoul will be subdued, and faith, grasping the promises and relying\nupon Jesus, will prove triumphant.—The Review and Herald, June\n28, 1892."

And I\nwas afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground.”\nMatthew 25:24, 25.\nThe teaching of this parable is plain. All the gifts of intellect or\nof property which anyone has are entrusted to him. They are the\nLord’s goods, and are to be used to His honor and glory. They are to\nbe improved and increased by use, that the Lord may receive returns\nfrom them. But the Lord receives no returns from many talents; for,\nlike the unfaithful servant, those to whom they are entrusted put\nthem where they are not increased.\nAll in whose hearts selfishness is cherished will listen to the\ntemptations of Satan and will act the part of the unfaithful, slothful\nservant. They will hide their entrusted treasure, neglecting to use\ntheir talents for the Lord.... They have sown sparingly, or not at all,\nand they will reap sparingly. But although the Lord has told them\nthis in words too plain to be honestly misconstrued, they cherish\ndissatisfaction in their hearts, and complain that the Lord is a hard\nmaster, that they are dealt hardly and unjustly with....\nToday this work is being done by many who claim to know God.\nThey speak in a repining, complaining manner of the Lord’s require-\nments. They do not directly charge God with being unjust, but they\ncomplain of everything touching the question of using their influ-\nence or their means in His service. Whoever they may be, if those to\nwhom the Lord has entrusted His gifts do not make the best use of\ntheir endowments, if they do not cooperate with the heavenly angels\nby trying to be a blessing to their fellow human beings, they will\nreceive the denunciation from the Lord, Thou wicked and slothful\nservant. You had My gifts to use, but you neglected to use them....\nYou, who thought you knew so much, wickedly misrepresented Me\nUnfaithfulServant,April14 243\nandledotherstothinkthatIwasunjustlyhardandexacting. “Castye\nthe unprofitable servant into outer darkness; there shall be weeping\nand gnashing of teeth.” In that day these unfaithful servants will see\ntheir mistake and will realize that by selfishly putting their talents\nwhere the Lord could receive no increase from them, they have not\nonly lost all they had but have lost also the eternal riches.—The"

Those who utter them may\nbe poor in worldly possessions, but by faithfully giving to God the\nportion He claims, they acknowledge their indebtedness to Him.\nSelf-serving does not make up the chapters of their life history. In\nlove and gratitude, with songs of joy upon their lips, they bring their\nofferings to God, saying as did David, Of Thine own we freely give\nThee. “And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day\nWhatCanBe,April15 245\nwhen I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth\nhis own son that serveth him.”...\nThose who truly serve God will fear Him, but not as did the\nunfaithful servant, who hid his talent in the earth because he was\nafraid the Lord would receive His own.

Andyet, in His simplestimagerythere was a depth\nand beauty that the most educated minds could not exhaust....\nThe vine had often been used as a symbol of Israel, and the\nlesson Christ now gave His disciples was drawn from this.

The lofty\ncedar that was towering toward the skies, or the strong oak that\nspreads its branches and lifts them heavenward, He might have used\nto represent the stability and integrity of those who are followers\nof Christ.

It had no remarkable\nform that would at first sight give an impression of its value. It\nappeared to come up as a root out of dry ground, and attracted but\nlittle attention. But when attention was called to the plant, it was\nby some declared to be of heavenly origin. The people of Nazareth\nstood entranced as they saw its beauty; but when they received the\nidea that it would stand more gracefully and attract more attention\nthan themselves, they wrestled to uproot the precious plant, and cast\nit over the wall. The people of Jerusalem took the plant, and bruised\nit, and trampled it under their unholy feet. Their thought was to\ndestroy it forever. But the heavenly Husbandman never lost sight of\nHis plant.

But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded\nhim to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had,\nand payment to be made. The servant therefore fell down, and\nworshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay\nthee all. Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion,\nand loosed him, and forgave him the debt.\n“But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowser-\nvants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him,\nand took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. And his\nfellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have\npatience with me, and I will pay thee all. And he would not.”...\nThis parable is designed to show the spirit of tenderness and\ncompassion which we should manifest for others. The pardon of\nthis king represents a pardon that is supernatural-a divine forgive-\nness of all sin. Christ is represented by the king who, moved with\ncompassion, forgave the debt of his servant....\nWhen the debtor pleaded for delay with the promise, “Have\npatience with me, and I will pay thee all,” the sentence was revoked;\nthe whole debt was canceled, and he was soon given an opportunity\nto pattern after the master who had forgiven him.... But he who\nHowOftenShallIForgive? April19 253\nhad been so mercifully treated dealt with his fellow laborer in an\naltogether different manner....\nThe lesson to be learned is that we must have the spirit of true\nforgiveness, even as Christ forgives sinners, who can in no case pay\ntheir enormous debt.

He\ngives the father to understand that, had he been in the father’s place,\nhe would not have received the son back, and forgets that the poor\nprodigal is his own brother.

And the lawyer said, “Thou shalt\nlove the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and\nwith all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as\nthyself.”...\nThe lawyer had asked a plain, decided question, and the answer\nis equally plain and decided....

He avenged her, though he felt no pity or compassion\nfor her, though her misery was nothing to him. “And the Lord said,\nHear what the unjust judge saith.

He had endowed the holy pairwith powers\nofmindsuperiorto any otherliving creature thatHe hadmade. Their\nmental powers were but little lower than those of the angels.

If we will\ncome out from the world and be separate, and touch not the unclean,\nHe will receive us. Here are the conditions of our acceptance with\nGod. We have something to do ourselves. Here is a work for us.\nWe are to show our separation from the world. The friendship of\nthe world is enmity with God. It is impossible for us to be friends\nof the world and yet be in union with Christ. But what does this\nmean, to be friends of the world? It is to unite hands with them,\nto enjoy what they enjoy, to love that which they love, to seek for\npleasure, to seek for gratification, to follow our own inclinations.\nWe do not in following inclination have our affections upon God;\nwe are loving and serving ourselves. But here is a grand promise:\n“Come out from among them, and be ye separate.” Separate from\nwhat? The inclinations of the world, their tastes, their habits; the\nfashions, the pride, and the customs of the world.... In making this\nmove, in showing that we are not in harmony with the world, the\npromise of God is ours. He does not say perhaps I will receive you;\nbut “I will receive you.” It is a positive promise.\nYou have a surety that you will be accepted of God. Then in sep-\narating from the world you connect yourself with God; you become\na member of the royal family; you become sons and daughters of\nthe Lord Almighty; you are children of the heavenly King, adopted\ninto His family, and have a hold from above, united with the infinite\nGod whose arm moves the world.\nWhat an exalted privilege is this to be thus favored, thus honored\nof God, to be called sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty. It is\nincomprehensible; but still, with all these promises and encourage-\nments, there are many who question and hesitate. They are in an\nComeandBeSeparate,May15 307\nundecided position. They seem to think that if they were to become\nChristians, there would be a mountain of responsibilities to be borne\nin religious duties and Christian obligations. There is a mountain of\nresponsibility, a lifetime of watchfulness, of battling with their own\ninclinations, with their own wills, with their own desires, with their\nown pleasures; and as they look at it, it seems like an impossibility\nfor them to take the step, to decide that they will be children of God,\nWalk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, being fruitful in\nevery good work and increasing in the knowledge of God.\nColossians 1:10.\nI am reminded of an incident I once read, of an aged gentleman\nwho had been broken down by hard labor and yet was seeking some\nemployment by which he could obtain means. A nobleman who had\na hundred cords of wood to cut was informed of the wish of the old\ngentleman. He told him that if he would cut the wood he should\nhave one hundred dollars for the job. But the old gentleman replied,\nNo, he could never do that. It was impossible. He was an old man,\nand not able to undertake such a job. “Well,” said the nobleman,\n“we will make a different bargain. Can you cut one cord today? If\nso, I will give you one dollar.” The bargain was made, and the cord\nof wood was cut that day. “Now,” said the nobleman, “you may cut\nanother cord tomorrow,” and another cord was cut the next day; and\nthus the whole job was accomplished. In one hundred days the work\nwas completed, and the laborer was in just as good health as when\nhe commenced the work. He could take it cord by cord, but when\npresented to him in one large job, the accomplishment of it seemed\nimpossible.\nThis well represents the cases of many who are undecided. They\nhave a desire to be Christians, yet the responsibilities of a Christian\nlife seem so great to them that they fear they will make a failure,\n[and] are almost certain they can never reach the mark if they make\nthe attempt. But when it is taken into consideration that it is not for\nthem to see the end of the Christian’s journey, it is not for them to\ncomprehend and accomplish it at once. Only one day at a time with\nits burdens and responsibilities is presented to us.\nYes, dear friends, dear youth, tomorrow is not yours. It is the\nduties of today that you are to perform. If you resolve to be on the\nLord’s side, and come out from among the world and be separate,\nOneDayataTime,May16 309\nand choose to be sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty, to leave\nthe ranks of the enemy, the service of sin and of Satan, make up your\nmind to always do present duty.

Matthew 7:13, 14.\nThese roads are distinct, separate, and in opposite directions.\nOne leads to eternal life, the other to death, eternal death. There is a\ndistinction between these roads, also between the companies travel-\ning in them. One road is broad and smooth; the other is narrow and\nrugged. So the parties that travel in them are opposite in character,\nlife, dress, and conversation.\nThose traveling in the narrow way are talking of the joy and\nhappiness at the end of the journey. Their countenances are often\nsad, yetbeam withholy, sacredjoy. A Man ofsorrowandacquainted\nwith grief opened that road for them, and traveled it Himself. His\nfollowers see His footsteps and are comforted. He went through\nsafely; so can they if they follow Him.\nIn the broad road all are occupied with their dress and the plea-\nsures in the way. They freely indulge in hilarity and glee, and think\nnot of their journey’s end, of the certain destruction that awaits them\nthere. Every day they approach nearer their destination, yet they\nmadly rush on, faster and faster.\nWhy is it so hard to lead a self-denying, humble life?

It is\nperilous to leave this solemn duty in the hands of others. This peril\nis well illustrated by an incident that is related concerning a Hebrew\nfamily on the night of the Passover.\nThe legend goes that the eldest daughter was sick, but that she\nwas acquainted with the fact that a lamb was to be chosen for every\nfamily, and that its blood was to be sprinkled upon the lintel and side\nposts of the door so that the Lord might behold the mark of the blood\nand not suffer the destroyer to enter in to smite the firstborn. With\nwhat anxiety she saw the evening approach when the destroying\nangel was to pass by. She became very restless. She called her father\nto her side, and asked, “Have you marked the doorpost with blood?”\nHe answered, “Yes, I have given directions in regard to the matter.\nDo not be troubled, for the destroying angel will not enter here.”\nThe night came on, and again and again the child called her\nfather, still asking, “Are you sure that the doorpost is marked with\nblood?” Again and again the father assured her that she need have no\nfear, that a command which involved such consequences would not\nbe neglected by his trustworthy servants. As midnight approached,\nher pleading voice was heard saying, “Father, I am not sure. Take\nme in your arms, and let me see the mark for myself, so that I can\nrest.”\nThe father conceded to the wishes of his child; he took her in his\narms and carried her to the door; but there was no blood mark upon\nBloodontheDoorpost,May30 337\nthe lintel or the posts. He trembled with horror as he realized that\nhis home might have become a house of mourning. With his own\nhands he seized the hyssop bough and sprinkled the doorpost with\nblood.

No one needed to\nconsult the learned doctors as to His meaning. He did not perplex\nthe ignorant with mysterious inferences nor use unaccustomed and\nlearnedwordsofwhichtheyhadnoknowledge.

It is not learning of the world’s\ngreat persons that opens the mysteries of the plan of redemption.\nThe priests and rabbis had studied the prophecies, but they failed to\ndiscover the precious proofs of the Messiah’s advent, of the manner\nof His coming, of His mission and character. Those who claimed to\nbe worthy of confidence because of their wisdom did not perceive\nthat Christ was the Prince of life.\nThe rabbis looked with suspicion and contempt upon everything\nthat did not bear the appearance of worldly wisdom, national ex-\naltation, and religious exclusiveness; but the mission of Jesus was\nto oppose these very evils, to correct these erroneous views, and to\nAsaRootOutofDryGround,June20 381\nwork a reformation in faith and morals. He attracted attention to\npurity of life, to humility of spirit, and to devotion to God and His\ncause without hope of worldly honor or reward....\nHe rejoiced in spirit as He beheld the poor of this world eagerly\naccepting the precious message which He brought. He looked up to\nheaven and said, “I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,\nbecause thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and\nhast revealed them unto babes.”—The Review and Herald, August\n3, 1911.\nFoxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of\nMan has nowhere to lay His head. Matthew 8:20.\nChrist came to this world to live a life of perfect obedience to\nthe laws of God’s kingdom. He came to uplift and ennoble human\nbeings, to work out an enduring righteousness for them. He came as\na medium through which truth was to be imparted. In Him are found\nall the excellencies necessary to absolute perfection of character....\nChrist gave up His high command in the heavenly courts, and\nlayingasideHisroyalrobeandkinglycrown, HeclothedHisdivinity\nwith humanity. For our sakes He became poor in earthly riches and\nadvantages, that human beings might be rich in the eternal weight\nof glory. He took His place at the head of the human family and\nconsented to endure in our behalf the trials and temptations that sin\nhas brought. He might have come in power and great glory, escorted\nby a multitude of heavenly angels. But no, He came in humility,\nof lowly parentage. He was brought up in an obscure and despised\nvillage. He lived a life of poverty and suffered often with privation\nand hunger. This He did to show that earthly riches and high rank\ndo not increase the value of souls in the sight of God. He has given\nus no encouragement to think that riches make anyone worthy of\neternal life. Those church members who, when a brother becomes\npoor, treat him as if he were unworthy of their notice certainly did\nnot learn this from Christ....\nIt is submission to sin that brings the great unhappiness of the\nsoul. It is not poverty but disobedience that lessens our hope of\ngaining eternal life, which the Savior came to bring us. True riches,\ntrue peace, true content, enduring happiness-these are found only in\nentire surrender to God, in perfect reconciliation to His will.\nChrist came to our world to live a life of stainless purity, thus\nto show sinners that in His strength they, too, can obey God’s holy\nprecepts, the laws of His kingdom.

The Bible speaks of this as if it were an\nimpossibility that anyone should venture to do such a thing. “Yet ye\nhave robbed me.”...\nThe Lord saw just how it would be when the world was filled\nwith inhabitants, and therefore He makes a covenant with His people\nthat they should give Him their tithes and offerings, according to the\narrangement which He has made. This is His. It does not belong to\nany of you. God has made this arrangement with you, that you may\nshow that you realize your dependence and accountability to God\nby returning to Him His portion. If you do this, His blessing will\ncome upon you. All that we have is the Lord’s, entrusted to us as\nHis stewards. That which we hand back to Him He must first give\nto us....\nWe breathe because God takes charge of the human machinery.\nDay by day He keeps it in working order, and He wants us to think\nof the infinite sacrifice He has made for us in suffering with One\nequal with Himself-His only begotten Son. He consented to let Him\ncome to a world all seared and marred with the curse of sin, to stand\nat the head of humanity as a sin-bearing, sin-pardoning Savior....\nChrist declared that all power in heaven and earth has been given\nto Him.... He takes His position at the head of humanity, covering\nhumanity with divinity....\nGod forbid that any one of us should fail of gaining the precious\nboon of eternal life. Do not rob God. Walk honestly before Him. All\nis His. He has entrusted goods to His agents for the advancement of\nHis work in the world. They are to bring to His treasury a faithful\ntithe, and besides this they are to bring gifts and offerings as the\ncause shall demand....

Matthew 5:3.\nThese comforting words of Christ are addressed not to the proud,\nnot to the boastful and self-conceited, but to those who realize their\nown weakness and sinfulness. Those who mourn, the meek who feel\nthemselves unworthy of the favor of God, and those who hunger and\nthirst after righteousness are all included in “the poor in spirit.”...\nThe poor in spirit feel their poverty, their want of the grace of\nChrist. They realize that they know little of God and His great love,\nand that they need light in order that they may know and keep the\nway of the Lord. They dare not face temptation in theirown strength,\nfor they realize that they have not moral force to resist evil. They\nhave no pleasure in reviewing their past life and little confidence in\nlooking to the future, for they are sick at heart. But it is to such that\nChrist says, “Blessed are the poor in spirit.” Christ saw that those\nwho feel their poverty may be made rich....\nWhat great privileges are within the reach of those who feel the\npoverty of their soul and submit to the will of God! The remedy for\nsoul poverty is found alone in Christ. When the heart is sanctified by\ngrace, when Christians have the mind of Christ, they have the love of\nChrist, whichis spiritualriches more precious than the goldofOphir.\nBut before there can be an intense desire for the wealth contained\nin Christ, which is available to all who feel their poverty, there\nmust be a sense of need. When the heart is full of self-sufficiency\nand preoccupied with the superficial things of earth, the Lord Jesus\nrebukes and chastens in order that men and women may awake to a\nrealization of their true condition....\nYou may come to Jesus in faith and without delay. His provision\nis rich and free, His love is abundant, and He will give you grace\nto wear His yoke and to lift His burden with cheerfulness.

The abiding presence of meekness is an\nunmistakable evidence that we are branches of the True Vine and are\nbearing much fruit. It is an evidence that we are by faith beholding\nthe King in His beauty and becoming changed into His likeness.\nWhere meekness exists, the natural tendencies are under the control\nof the Holy Spirit. Meekness is not a species of cowardice. It is the\nspirit which Christ manifested when suffering injury, when enduring\ninsult and abuse. To be meek is not to surrender our rights, but it\nis the preservation of self-control under provocation to give way to\nanger or to the spirit of retaliation. Meekness will not allow passion\nto take the lines.\nWhen Christ was accused by the priests and Pharisees, He pre-\nserved His self-control, but He took His position decidedly that their\ncharges were untrue. He said to them, “Which of you convinceth\nme of sin?”... He knew that His position was right. When Paul and\nSilas were beaten and thrust into prison without trial or sentence,\nthey did not surrender their right to be treated as honest citizens....\nAt all times and in all places Christians should be that which\nthe Lord designs that they should be-free in Christ Jesus.

We should ever cultivate an earnest desire for the righ-\nteousness of Christ. No temporal wants should attract and divert\nthe mind to such a degree that we should not experience this soul\nhunger to possess the attributes of Christ.... When in trouble and\naffliction, the soul longs for the love and power of God. There is an\nintense desire for assurance, for hope, for faith, for confidence. We\nshould seek for pardon, for peace, for the righteousness of Christ....\nEvery soul who seeks the Lord with the whole heart is hungering\nand thirsting after righteousness....\nThe soul hunger will be satisfied when our hearts are emptied\nof pride, vanity, and selfishness; for faith will then appropriate the\npromises of God, and Christ will supply the vacuum and abide in\nthe heart. There will be a new song in the mouth, for the word will\nbe fulfilled, “A new heart also will I give you.” The testimony of the\nbeliever will be, “Of his fulness have all we received, and grace for\ngrace.”...\nWithout Christ the hunger and thirst of the soul would remain\nunsatisfied.

        "content": "It came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the\nground to the Lord. Abel also brought of the firstborn of his\nflock and of their fat. And the Lord respected Abel and his\noffering, but He did not respect Cain and his offering. Genesis\n4:3-5.\nCain and Abel, the sons of Adam, were unlike in character....\nThese brothers were tested, as Adam had been tested before them,\nto see if they would be obedient to God’s requirements. They had\nbeen instructed in regard to the provision made for the salvation of\nthe human race. Through the system of sacrificial offerings, God\ndesigned to impress upon people’s minds the offensive character of\nsin and to make known to them its sure penalty, death. The offerings\nwere to be a constant reminder that it was only through the promised\nRedeemerthatmenandwomencouldcomeintothepresenceofGod.\nCain and Abel understood the system of offerings which they were\nrequired to carry out. They knew that in presenting these offerings\nthey showed humble and reverential obedience to the will of God\nand acknowledged faith in, and dependence upon, the Savior whom\nthese offerings typified.\nCain and Abel erected their altars alike, and each brought an\noffering. Cain thought it unnecessary to be particular about fulfilling\nallthe requirements ofGod; he therefore broughtan offering without\nthe shedding of blood. He brought of the fruits of the ground and\npresented his offering before the Lord; but there was no token from\nheaven to show that it was accepted. Abel entreated his brother to\ncome into the presence of God only in the divinely prescribed way.\nBut his remonstrances made Cain all the more determined to carry\nout his own purpose. As the eldest, he felt above being advised by\nhis brother, and despised his counsel.\nAbel brought of the firstlings of the flock, the very best, as God\nhad commanded him. In the slain lamb he sees by faith the Son of\nCainandAbelTested,July2 407\nGod, appointed to death because of the transgression of His Father’s\nlaw. God had respect to Abel’s offering. Fire flashes from heaven\nand consumes the sacrifice of the penitent sinner.\nCain now has an opportunity to see and acknowledge his mis-\ntake.... And He who is no respecter of persons will have respect to\nthe offering of faith and obedience....\nAbel’s offering had been accepted, but this was because Abel\nhad done in every particular as God required him to do.—Signs of\nSo the Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry? And why has\nyour countenance fallen? If you do well, will you not be\naccepted?” Genesis 4:6, 7.\nThe Lord was not ignorant of the feelings of resentment cher-\nished by Cain, but He would have Cain reflect upon his course, and,\nbecoming convinced of his sin, repent and set his feet in the path\nof obedience. There was no cause for his wrathful feelings toward\neither his brother or his God; it was his own disregard of the plainly\nexpressed will of God that had led to the rejection of his offering....\nAbel’s offering had been accepted, but this was because Abel had\ndone in every particular as God required him to do. This would not\nrob Cain of his birthright....Thus the matter was plainly laid open\nbefore Cain; but his combativeness was aroused because his course\nwas questioned and he was not permitted to follow his own inde-\npendent ideas. He was angry with God and angry with his brother.\nHe was angry with God because He would not accept the plans of a\nsinner in place of the divine requirements, and he was angry with\nhis brother for disagreeing with him....\nCain invites Abel to walk with him in the fields, and he there\ngives utterance to his unbelief and his murmuring against God. He\nclaims that he was doing well in presenting his offering; and the\nmore he talks against God and impeaches His justice and mercy in\nrejecting his own offering and accepting that of his brother Abel, the\nmore bitter are his feelings of anger and resentment.\nAbel defends the goodness and impartiality of God and places\nbefore Cain the simple reason why God did not accept his offering.\nThe fact that Abel ventured to disagree with him and even went\nso far as to point out his errors astonished Cain.... Cain’s reason told\nhim that Abel was right when he spoke of the necessity of presenting\nthe blood of a slain victim if he would have his sacrifice accepted,\nbut Satan presented the matter in a different light. He urged Cain on\nAngerofCain,July3 409\nto a furious madness, till he slew his brother, and the sin of murder\nBy faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than\nCain, through which he obtained witness that he was\nrighteous. Hebrews 11:4.\nThese two brothers, Cain and Abel, represent the whole human\nfamily. They were both tested on the point of obedience, and all will\nbe tested as they were. Abel bore the proving of God. He revealed\nthe gold of a righteous character, the principles of true godliness.\nBut Cain’s religion had not a good foundation; it rested on human\nmerit. He brought to God something in which he had a personal\ninterest-the fruits of the ground, which had been cultivated by his\ntoil; and he presented his offering as a favor done to God through\nwhich he expected to secure the divine approval. He obeyed in\nbuilding an altar, obeyed in bringing a sacrifice, but it was only a\npartial obedience. The essential part, the recognition of the need of\na Redeemer, was left out....\nBoth were sinners, and both acknowledged the claims of God\nas an object of worship. To all outward appearance, their religion\nwas the same up to a certain point of time; but the Bible history\nshows us that there was a time when the difference between the two\nbecame very great. This difference lay in the obedience of one and\nthe disobedience of the other.\nThe apostle says that Abel offered unto God a more excellent\nsacrifice than Cain. Abel grasped the great principles of redemption.\nHe saw himself a sinner, and he saw sin and its penalty, death,\nstanding between his soul and communion with God. He brought\nthe slain victim, the sacrificed life, thus acknowledging the claims\nof the law which had been transgressed. Through the shed blood he\nlooked to the future Sacrifice, Christ dying on the cross of Calvary;\nand, trusting in the atonement that was there to be made, he had the\nwitness that he was righteous and his offering accepted.\nMoreExcellentSacrifice,July4 411\nHow did Abel know so well the plan of salvation? Adam taught\nit to his children and grandchildren.... After Adam had sinned, a\nfeeling of terror seized him. A constant dread was upon him; shame\nand remorse tortured his soul. In this state of mind he wished to\nbe as far removed as possible from the presence of God, whom he\nhad so loved to meet in his Eden home. But the Lord followed this\nconscience-stricken man, and while He condemned the sin of which\nAdam had been guilty, gave him words of gracious promise.—Signs"

        "content": "“I willputenmity... between thy seedandherseed; itshallbruise\nthy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.”\nThis was the first gospel sermon ever preached to sinners; this\npromise was the star of hope, illuminating the dark and dismal\nfuture of the race. Adam gladly received the welcome assurance of\ndeliverance and diligently instructed his children in the way of the\nLord. This promise was presented in close connection with the altar\nof sacrificial offerings. The altar and the promise stand side by side,\nand one casts clear beams of light upon the other, showing that the\njustice of an offended God could be appeased only by the death of\nHis beloved Son....\nAbel heard these precious lessons, and to him they were like\nseed sown on good ground. Cain also heard them. He had the same\nprivileges as his brother, but he did not improve them. He ventured\nto go contrary to the commands of God, and the result is strongly\npresented before us. Cain was not the victim of an arbitrary purpose;\none was not elected to be chosen of God, and the other to be rejected.\nThe whole matter rested upon doing or not doing as God had said.\nIn the case of Cain and Abel we have a type of two classes that\nwill exist in the world till the close of time; and this type is worthy\nof close study. There is a marked difference in the characters of\nthese two brothers, and the same difference is seen in the human\nfamily today. Cain represents those who carry out the principles and\nworks of Satan, by worshipping God in a way of their own choosing.\nLike the leader whom they follow, they are willing to render partial\nobedience but not entire submission to God....\nThe Cain class of worshippers includes by farthe largest number,\nfor every false religion that has been invented has been based on the\nFirstPromiseoftheGospel,July5 413\nCain principle, that a sinner can depend upon his own merits and\nrighteousness for salvation....\nThe religion of Christ is for men and women to accept with all\nits inconveniences. They may invent an easier way, but it will not\nlead to the city of God, the saints’ secure abode. Only those who “do\nhis commandments” will have “right to the tree of life” and “enter in\nthrough the gates into the city.”—The Signs of the Times, December\n23, 1886.\nAfter he begot Methuselah, Enoch walked with God three\nhundred years. Genesis 5:22.\nEnoch learned from the lips of Adam the painful story of the\nfall and the precious story of God’s condescending grace in the gift\nof His Son as the world’s Redeemer. He believed and relied upon\nthe promise given. Enoch was a holy man. He served God with\nsingleness of heart. He realized the corruptions of the human family\nand separated himself from the descendants of Cain and reproved\nthem for their great wickedness. There were those upon the earth\nwho acknowledged God, who feared and worshipped Him. Yet\nrighteous Enoch was so distressed with the increasing wickedness\nof the ungodly that he would not daily associate with them, fearing\nthat he should be affected by their infidelity and that he might not\never regard God with that holy reverence which was due His exalted\ncharacter. His soul was vexed as he daily beheld them trampling\nupon the authority of God. He chose to be separate from them\nand spent much of his time in solitude, giving himself to reflection\nand prayer. He waited before God and prayed to know His will\nmore perfectly, that he might perform it. God communed with\nEnoch through His angels and gave him divine instruction. He made\nknown to him that He would not always bear with human beings in\ntheir rebellion-that it was His purpose to destroy the sinful race by\nbringing a flood of waters upon the earth.\nThe beautiful Garden of Eden, from which our first parents had\nbeen driven, remained until God determined to destroy the earth by\na flood. The Lord had planted that garden and especially blessed\nit, and in His wonderful providence He withdrew it from the earth\nand will return it again, more gloriously adorned than before it was\nremoved. God purposed to preserve a specimen of His perfect work\nof creation free from the curse which sin had brought upon the\nearth....\nEnoch,July6 415\nEnoch continued to grow more heavenly while communing with\nGod. His face was radiant with a holy light.... The Lord loved\nEnoch, because he steadfastly followed Him.... He yearned to unite\nhimself still more closely to God, whom he feared, reverenced, and\nadored. The Lord would not permit Enoch to die like others, but\nsent His angels to take him to heaven without seeing death. In the\npresence of the righteous and the wicked, Enoch was removed from\nNow Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these\nmen also, saying, “Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands\nof His saints.” Jude 14.\nThe Lord opened... to Enoch the plan of salvation and by the\nSpirit of prophecy carried him down through the generations which\nshould live after the Flood, and showed him the great events con-\nnected with the second coming of Christ and the end of the world.\nEnoch was troubled in regard to the dead. It seemed to him\nthat the righteous and the wicked would go to the dust together,\nand that would be their end. He could not see the life of the just\nbeyond the grave. In prophetic vision he was instructed in regard to\nthe Son of God, who was to die as a sacrifice, and was shown the\ncoming of Christ in the clouds of heaven, attended by the angelic\nhost, to give life to the righteous dead and ransom them from their\ngraves. He also saw the corrupt state of the world at the time when\nChrist should appear the second time-that there would be a boastful,\npresumptuous, self-willed generation arrayed in rebellion against the\nlaw of God, denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ,\ntrampling upon His blood and despising His atonement. He saw\nthe righteous crowned with glory and honor, while the wicked were\nseparated from the presence of the Lord and consumed with fire....\nBy the blessings and honors which He bestowed upon Enoch,\nthe Lord teaches a lesson of the greatest importance, that all will\nbe rewarded who by faith rely upon the promised Sacrifice and\nfaithfully obey God’s commandments. Here, again, two classes are\nrepresented which were to exist until the second coming of Christ-\nthe righteous and the wicked, the loyal and the rebellious. God will\nremember the righteous, who fear Him. On account of His dear Son,\nHe will respect and honor them and give them everlasting life. But\nthe wicked, who trample upon His authority, He will destroy from\nthe earth, and they will be as though they had not been.\nEnochandtheSpiritofProphecy,July7 417\nAfter Adam’s fall from a state of perfect happiness to a condition\nof sin and misery, there was danger that men and women would\nbecome discouraged.... But the instructions which God gave to\nAdam, and which were repeated by Seth and fully exemplified by\nEnoch, cleared away the gloom and darkness, and gave hope to\nall, that as through Adam came death, through Jesus, the promised\nRedeemer, would come life and immortality.—Signs of the Times,"

They, with\nsome others, received instruction from Noah and assisted him in his\nIn the Lord all the descendants of Israel shall be justified, and\nshall glory. Isaiah 45:25.\nAbraham was called out from an idolatrous family and was\nappointed of God to preserve His truth amid the prevailing and\nincreasing corruptions of that idolatrous age. The Lord appeared to\nAbraham and said, “I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and\nbe thou perfect. And I will make my covenant between me and thee,\nand will multiply thee exceedingly.”...\nThe Lord communicated His will to Abraham and gave him a\ndistinct knowledge of the requirements of the moral law and of the\nsalvation that would be accomplished through Himself. It was a\nhigh honor to which Abraham was called, that of being the father of\nthe people who for centuries were the guardians and preservers of\nthe truth of God for the world-of that people through whom all the\nnations of the earth should be blessed in the advent of the promised\nMessiah....\nGod conferred upon His faithful servant special honor and bless-\nings. Through vision and through the angels that walked and talked\nwith him as friend with friend, he was made acquainted with the\npurposes as well as with the will of God....\nBut the descendants of Abraham departed from the worship\nof the true God and transgressed His law. They mingled with the\nnations who had no knowledge or fear of God before their eyes, and\ngradually imitated their customs and manners until God’s anger was\nkindled against them, and He permitted them to have their own way\nand follow the devices of their own corrupt hearts....\nBut when they humbled themselves before God and acknowl-\nedged His dealings and cried unto Him earnestly for deliverance\nfrom the oppressive yoke of the Egyptians, their cries and their\npromises to be obedient reached heaven.

Genesis 22:2.\n[Abraham] was one hundred and twenty years old when this\nterrible and startling command came to him in a vision of the night.\nHe was to travel three days’ journey and would have ample time for\nreflection. Fifty years previous, at the divine command, he had left\nfather and mother, relatives and friends, and had become a pilgrim\nand a stranger in a land not his own. He had obeyed the command\nof God to send away his son Ishmael to wander in the wilderness.\nHis soul was bowed down with grief at this separation, and his faith\nwas sorely tried, yet he submitted because God required it....\nAbraham was tempted to believe that after all, this might be a\ndelusion. Stricken with grief, he bowed before God and prayed as\nnever before for a confirmation of this strange command, for greater\nlight if he must perform this terrible duty. He remembered the angels\nsent to tell him of God’s purpose to destroy Sodom and those who\nbore to him the promise that he should have this same son Isaac....\nHe finally awakened Isaac softly, informing him that he was\ncommanded of God to offer sacrifice upon a distant mountain, and\nthat he must accompany him.

Genesis\n28:16.\nJacob awoke with a solemn sense of the presence of God....\nThrough the Spirit of God, the plan of redemption was revealed to\nhim, not fully, but such parts as it was essential for him to know.\nThe time of Christ’s first advent was yet far in the future, but God\nwould not let His servant remain in ignorance of the fact that sinful\nmen and women have been provided an Advocate with the Father.\nUp to the time of Adam and Eve’s rebellion against the govern-\nment of God, there had been free communion with God. Heaven and\nearth had been connected by a path that the Lord loved to traverse.\nBut the sin of Adam and Eve separated earth from heaven. The curse\nof sin was upon the human race and was so offensive to God that\nfallen humanity could have no communion with their Maker, how-\never much they might desire it. They could not climb the battlements\nof heaven and enter the city of God, for there entereth into it nothing\nthat defileth. The ladder represents Jesus, the appointed medium of\ncommunication. Had He not with His own merits bridged the gulf\nthat sin had made, the ministering angels, ascending and descending\non that ladder, would have held no communication with sinners.\nAll this was revealed to Jacob in his dream. Although his mind at\nonce grasped a part of the revelation, its great and mysterious truths\nwere the study of his lifetime and unfolded to his understanding\nmore and more. In his conversation with Nathanael, Jesus referred\nto this mystic ladder on which Jacob gazed with pleased wonder.\nSaidHe, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafterye shallsee heaven\nopen, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son\nof man.”\nIt is our lifework to commence at the lowest round of the ladder\nandstepbysteptoascendtowardheaven....

But when\nhe saw the carriages and the long line of loaded animals, and when\nBenjamin was at his side once more, he felt reassured and, in the\nfullness of his joy, exclaimed, “It is enough; Joseph my son is\nyet alive: I will go and see him before I die.” The brothers then\nmade their humiliating confession to their father and entreated his\nforgiveness for their wicked treatment of Joseph. Jacob had not\nsuspected them of such cruelty, but he saw that God had overruled it\nall for good, and he forgave and blessed his erring children....\nIn a vision of the night the divine words came to Jacob, “Fear not\nto go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation. I\nwill go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee\nup again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.”\nThe meeting of Joseph and his father was very affective. Joseph\nleft his chariot and ran to meet his father on foot and embraced him,\nand they wept over each other. “And Israel said unto Joseph, Now\nlet me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.”...\n[Jacob’s] last years were more peaceful. His sons had turned\nfrom their evil ways, Joseph had been restored to him, and, sur-\nrounded by every comfort which the prime minister of Egypt could\nbestow, and in the society of his children, he passed down gently\nand calmly toward the grave.\nA short time before his death, his children gathered about him\nto receive his blessing and to listen to his last words of counsel.

        "verse_ref": "Genesis 50:20",
        "content": "Jacob predicted a cheerful future for most of his sons. Especially\nfor Joseph he uttered words of eloquence of a happy character:\n“Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose\nbranches run over the wall: the archers have sorely grieved him, and\nshot at him, and hated him: but his bow abode in strength, and the\narms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God\nof Jacob.”...\nThe life of Joseph illustrates the life of Christ. Joseph’s brethren\nproposed to kill him but were finally content to sell him as a slave to\nprevent his becoming greater than themselves. They thought they\nhad placed him where they would be no more troubled with his\ndreams and where there would not be a possibility of their fulfill-\nment. But the very course which they pursued, God overruled to\nbring about that which they designed never should take place-that\nhe should have dominion over them....\nJoseph walked with God. And when he was imprisoned and suf-\nfered because of his innocence, he meekly bore it without murmur-\ning. His self-control, his patience in adversity, and his unwavering\nfidelity are left on record for the benefit of all who should afterward\nlive on the earth....\nThe life of Jesus, the Savior of the world, was a pattern of\nbenevolence, goodness, and holiness. Yet He was despised and\ninsulted, mocked and derided, for no other reason than because His\nrighteous life was a constant rebuke to sin. His enemies would not\nbe satisfied until He was given into their hands, that they might put\nHim to a shameful death. He died for the guilty race and, while\nsuffering the most cruel torture, meekly forgave His murderers. He\nrose from the dead, ascended up to His Father, and received all\nJoseph,aTypeofChrist,July15 433\npower and authority, and returned to the earth again to impart it to\nHis disciples. He “gave gifts unto men.” Andallwho have evercome\nto Him repentant, confessing their sins, He has received into His\nfavor and freely pardoned. And if they remain true to Him, He will\nexalt them to His throne and make them His heirs to the inheritance\nwhich He has purchased with His own blood.—Signs of the Times,\nThe children of Israel groaned because of the bondage, and\nthey cried out; and their cry came up to God because of the\nbondage. Exodus 2:23.\nMoses had become, in every sense, a great man. As a writer, as\na military leader, and as a philosopher, he had no superior. Love\nof truth and righteousness had become the basis of his character\nand had produced a steadfastness of purpose which no fickleness of\nfashion, opinion, or pursuits could influence. Courtesy, diligence,\nand a firm trust in God marked his life. He was young and vigor-\nous, overflowing with energy and manly strength. He had deeply\nsympathized with his brethren in their affliction, and his soul had\nkindled with a desire to deliver them. Surely, it would appear to\nhuman wisdom that he was in every way fitted for his work.\nBut God seeth not as man sees; His ways are not as ours. Moses\nis not yet prepared to accomplish this great work; neither are the\npeople prepared for deliverance. He has been educated in the school\nof Egypt, but he has yet to pass through the stern school of discipline\nbefore he is qualified for his sacred mission. Before he can success-\nfully govern the hosts of Israel, he must learn to obey, he must learn\nself-control. For forty long years he is sent into the retirement of the\ndesert, that, in his life of obscurity, in the humble work of caring for\nthe sheep and lambs of the flock, he may gain the victory over his\nown passions. He must learn entire submission to the will of God\nbefore he can teach that will to a great people.\nShort-sighted mortals would have dispensed with that forty years\nof training amid the mountains of Midian, deeming it a great loss\nof time. But Infinite Wisdom placed him who was to be the mighty\nstatesman, the deliverer of his people from slavery, in circumstances\nduring this period to develop his honesty, his forethought, his faith-\nfulness and caretaking, and his ability to identify himself with the\nnecessities of his dumb charge. Those to whom God has entrusted\nFortyYearsofRetraining,July16 435\nimportant responsibilities have not been brought up in ease and\nluxury; the noble prophets, the leaders and judges of God’s appoint-\nment, have been those whose characters were formed by the stern\nrealities of life.\nGod does not select for His work persons of one mold and one\ntemperament only, but individuals of varied temperaments.—Signs\nThen Moses was content to live with the man [the priest of\nMidian] Exodus 2:21.\nThe human element is seen in all who have been chosen to\naccomplish a work for God.... Connected with God, the source of\nall wisdom, individuals may reach any height of moral excellence....\nMoses had been learning much which he must unlearn. The in-\nfluence which had surrounded him in Egypt-the love of his adopted\nmother, his own high position as the king’s grandson, the enchant-\nments of grandeur in art, the dissipation on every hand, the imposing\ndisplay connected with the idolatrous worship, and the constant rep-\netition, by the priests, of countless fables concerning the power of\ntheir gods-all had left deep impressions upon his developing mind\nand had molded, to some extent, his habits and character. These\nimpressions, time, change of surroundings, and close connection\nwith God could remove. Yet it must be by earnest, persevering effort,\na struggle as for life, with himself, to uproot the seeds of error, and\nin their place have truth firmly implanted. At every point Satan\nwould be prepared to strengthen error and dislodge truth, but while\nGod designed that Moses should be self-trained by severe discipline,\nHe Himself would be his ever-ready helper against Satan when the\nconflict should be too severe for human strength....\nThe light of nature and that of revelation are from the same\nsource, teaching grand truths and always agreeing with each other.\nAs Moses saw that all God’s created works act in sublime harmony\nwith His laws, he realized how unreasonable it is for humans to\narray themselves in opposition to the law of God. The conflict was\nmost trying, the effort long, to bring heart and mind on all points\nin harmony with truth and with heaven; but Moses was finally a\nvictor....\nAs year after year passed by and left the servant of God still\nin his humble position, it would have seemed to one of less faith\nUnlearningExperience,July17 437\nthan he as if God had forgotten him, as if his ability and experience\nwere to be lost to the world. But as he wandered with his silent\nflocks in solitary places, the abject condition of his people was ever\nbefore him. He recounted all God’s dealings with the faithful in\nages past and His promises of future good, and his soul went out\ntoward God in behalf of his brethren in bondage, and his fervent\nprayers echoed amid the mountain caverns by day and by night. He\nwas never weary of presenting before God the promises made to His\npeople, and pleading with Him for their deliverance.—Signs of the\nCome now, therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh that you\nmay bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.\nExodus 3:10.\nTo the oppressed and suffering Hebrews the day of their deliver-\nance seemed to be long deferred, but in His own appointed time God\ndesigned to work for them in mighty power. Moses was not to stand,\nas he at first anticipated, at the head of armies, with waving banners\nand glittering armor. That people, so long abused and oppressed,\nwere not to gain the victory for themselves by rising up and asserting\ntheir rights. God’s purpose was to be accomplished in a way to pour\ncontempt on human pride and glory. The deliverer was to go forth\nas a humble shepherd with only a rod in his hand; but God would\nmake that rod powerful in delivering His people from oppression\nand in preserving them when pursued by their enemies.\nBefore Moses went forth, he received his high commission to\nhis great work in a way that filled him with awe and gave him a\ndeep sense of his own weakness and unworthiness. While engaged\nin his round of duties, he saw a bush, branches, foliage, and trunk,\nall burning, yet not consumed. He drew near to view the wonderful\nsight, when a voice addressed him from out of the flame. It was\nthe voice of God. It was He who, as an angel of the covenant, had\nrevealed Himself to the fathers in ages past. The frame of Moses\nquivered, he was thrilled with terror, as the Lord called him by name.\nWith trembling lips he answered, “Here am I.” He was warned not to\napproach his Creator with undue familiarity: “Put off thy shoes from\noff thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.”...\nFinite creatures may learn a lesson that should never be forgot-\nten-to approach God with reverence. We may come boldly into His\npresence presenting the name of Jesus, our righteousness and substi-\ntute, but never with the boldness of presumption as though He were\non a level with ourselves. We have heard some address the great and\nCallofMoses,July18 439\nall-powerful and holy God, who dwelleth in light unapproachable,\nas they would not address an equal or even an inferior.... God is\ngreatly to be reverenced; wherever His presence is clearly realized,\nsinners will bow in the most humble attitude.—Signs of the Times,"

Here\nthe king and all Egypt had evidence which their vain philosophy\ncould not dispose of, that this work was not accomplished by magic,\nbut was a judgment from the God of heaven.\nWhen the king was relieved of his immediate distress, he again\nstubbornly refused to let Israel go.

Pharaoh called upon the magicians\nto do the same with their enchantments, but they could not.... The\nmagicians themselves acknowledged that their imitative power was\nat an end, saying, “This is the finger of God.” But the king was still\nunmoved.\nStill another trial was made, after another appeal to “let my\npeople go.” Flies filled the houses and swarmed upon the ground,\nso that “the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.”\nThese were not such flies as harmlessly annoy us at some seasons\nof the year, but they were large and venomous. Their sting was\nvery painful to man and beast. It had been previously stated that the\nland of Goshen would be exempt from this visitation, which was\naccordingly found to be true.\nPharaoh now sent for the two brothers and told them that he\nwould allow the Israelites to offer sacrifices in Egypt itself; but\nthis offer was refused. Certain animals were regarded as objects\nof worship by the Egyptians, and such was the reverence in which\nthese creatures were held that to slay one, even accidentally, was\na crime punishable with death.

        "content": "The people of Egypt were in despair. The scourges which had\nalready fallen upon them seemed almost beyond endurance, and they\nwere filled with fears for the future. The people had worshipped\nPharaoh as being a representative of their god and carrying out his\npurposes. But notwithstanding, many were convinced that he was\nopposing his will to a superior Power who held all nations under\nHis control. Suddenly a darkness settled over the land, so thick and\nblack that it seemed a darkness which could be felt. Not only were\nthe people deprived of light, but the atmosphere was very oppressive,\nso that breathing was difficult.... But all the children of Israel had\nlight and a pure atmosphere in their dwellings....\nThe Hebrew slaves were continually favored of God and were\nbecoming confident that they would be delivered. The taskmasters\ndared not exercise their cruelty as heretofore, fearing lest the vast\nHebrew host would rise up and be revenged for the abuse they had\nalready suffered.\nThis terrible darkness lasted three days, and during this time\nthe busy activities of life could not be carried on. This was God’s\nplan. He would give them time for reflection and repentance before\nbringing upon them the last and most dreadful scourge, the death\nof the firstborn. He would remove everything which would divert\ntheir attention and give them time for meditation, thus giving new\nevidence of His compassion and unwillingness to destroy.\nAt the end of the three days of darkness, Pharaoh sent for Moses\nand said, “Go ye, serve the Lord; only let your flocks and your herds\nbe stayed: let your little ones also go with you.” The answer was,\n“Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may\nsacrifice unto the Lord our God. Our cattle also shall go with us;\nDarknessOvertheLand,July27 457\nthere shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to\nserve the Lord our God; and we know not with what we must serve\nthe Lord, until we come thither.”\nThekingwassternanddetermined. “Gettheefromme,”hecried,\n“take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest\nmy face thou shalt die.” The answer was, “Thou hast spoken well, I\n1880."

God had been\nqualifying him, by manifestations of divine power, to stand at the\nhead of the armies of Israel and, as a shepherd of His people, to lead\nthem from Egypt. He was elevated above fear by his firm trust in\nGod. This courage in the presence of the king annoyed his haughty\npride, and he uttered the threat of killing the servant of God.

Moses was also to give his people instructions in regard\nto their leaving Egypt. On that night, so terrible to the Egyptians\nand so glorious to the people of God, the solemn ordinance of the\nPassover was instituted. By the divine command, each family, alone\nor in connection with others, was to slay a lamb or a goat “without\nblemish,” and with a bunch of hyssop sprinkle its blood on “the two\nside posts, and on the upper door post” of their houses, as a token,\nthat the destroying angel, coming at midnight, might not enter that\ndwelling. They were to eat the flesh roasted, with bitter herbs, at\nnight, as Moses said, “with your loins girded, your shoes on your\nfeet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is\nthe Lord’s passover.” This name was given in memory of the angel’s\npassing by their dwellings; and such a feast was to be observed as a\nmemorial by the people of Israel in all future generations.\nLeaven works secretly and is a fit emblem of hypocrisy and\ndeceit.

It was not enough to simply slay the lamb and\nsprinkle its blood upon the doorposts, but it was to be eaten, thus\nrepresenting the close union which must exist between Christ and\nHis followers.\nA work was required of the children of Israel to prove them and\nto show their faith in the great deliverance which God had been\nbringing about for them. In order to escape the terrible judgment\nPassover,July29 461\nabout to fall upon Egypt, the token of blood must be seen upon\ntheir houses.

        "content": "There were quite a number of the Egyptians who were led to\nacknowledge, by the manifestations of the signs and wonders shown\nin Egypt, that the gods whom they had worshipped were without\nknowledge and had no power to save or to destroy, and that the God\nof the Hebrews was the only true God. They begged to be permitted\nto come to the houses of the Israelites with their families upon that\nfearful night when the angel of God should slay the firstborn of the\nEgyptians. The Hebrews welcomed these believing Egyptians to\ntheir homes, and the latter pledged themselves henceforth to choose\nthe God of Israel as their God and to leave Egypt and go with the\nIsraelites to worship the Lord.\nThe Passoverpointedbackwardto the deliverance ofthe children\nof Israel and was also typical, pointing forward to Christ, the Lamb\nof God, slain for the redemption of fallen humanity. The blood\nsprinkled upon the doorposts prefigured the atoning blood of Christ\nand also the continual dependence of sinners upon the merits of that\nblood for safety from the power of Satan and for final redemption.\nChrist ate the Passover supper with His disciples just before His\ncrucifixion, and the same night instituted the ordinance of the Lord’s\nSupper, to be observed in commemoration of His death.... After par-\ntaking of the passover with His disciples, Christ arose from the table\nand said unto them, “With desire I have desired to eat this passover\nwith you before I suffer.” He then performed the humiliating office\nof washing the feet of His disciples. Christ gave His followers the\nordinance of washing feet for them to practice, which would teach\nthem lessons of humility....\nThe example of washing the feet of His disciples was given for\nthe benefit of all who should believe in Him....\nChrist,thePassoverLamb,July30 463\nThe salvation of men and women depends upon a continual\napplicationtotheirheartsofthecleansingbloodofChrist.

In the steps which the sinner must take in conversion-\nrepentance, faith, and baptism-He led the way. He did not repent for\nHimself, for He was sinless, but in behalf of sinners.\nJesus became “the repairer of the breach, the restorer of paths\nto dwell in.” He became an exile to earth to bring back the one lost,\nstraying sheep, the one world ruined by sin. In Him were combined\nthe earthly and the heavenly, the human and the divine; otherwise,\nHe could not be a Mediator whom the sinful could approach, and\nthrough whom they could be reconciled to their Maker. But now He\nencircles the race in arms of sympathy and love while He grasps the\nthrone of the Infinite, thus uniting us in our weakness and helpless-\nness with the Source of strength and power....\nWe are indebted to Jesus for all the blessings we enjoy. We\nshould be deeply grateful that we are the subjects of His intercession.\nBut Satan deceives men and women by presenting the service of\nChrist before them in a false light and making them think that it is a\ncondescension on their part to accept Jesus as their Redeemer. If we\nviewed the Christian privilege in the right light, we should consider\nit the highest exaltation to be accounted a child of God, an heir of\nheaven, and we should rejoice that we can walk with Jesus in His\nhumiliation....\nWill you leave the dark abodes of sin and woe, and seek the\nmansions Jesus has gone to prepare for His followers?

In every gentle,\ntender, and submissive way He sought to please those with whom\nHe came in contact; but though so gentle and submissive, no one\ncould lead Him to do anything that was contrary to the Word of God.\nSome admired His perfection of character and often sought to be\nwith Him, but others who regarded human sayings more than the\nWord of God turned away from Him and avoided His company....\nAs Jesus looked upon the offerings that were brought as a sac-\nrifice to the temple, the Holy Spirit taught Him that His life was to\nbe sacrificed for the life of the world.... From His earliest years He\nwas guarded by heavenly angels, yet His life was one long struggle\nagainst the powers of darkness. Satan sought in every way to tempt\nand try Him. He caused people to misunderstand His words so that\nthey might not receive the salvation He came to bring them....\nHe was faithful in obeying the commands of God, and this made\nHim very different from those around Him, who disregarded the\nWord of God. His stainless life was a rebuke, and many avoided His\npresence, but there were some who sought to be with Him because\nthey felt at peace where He was....\nHe did not fail nor become discouraged. He lived above the\ndifficulties of His life, as if in the light of God’s countenance. He\nbore insult patiently and in His human nature became an example\nfor all children and youth.\nChrist showed the greatest respect and love for His mother.\nThough she often talked with Him and sought to have Him do as\nHis brethren desired Him to do, He never showed her the least lack\nof devotion....\nExampleofLove,August8 483\nMary had felt greatly troubled when the priests and rulers came\nto her to complain about Jesus, but peace and confidence came to her\ntroubled heart as her Son showed her what the Scriptures said about\nHis practices.

        "content": "The first thirty years of the life of Christ were passed in the\nobscure village of Nazareth. The inhabitants of this village were\nproverbial for their wickedness, hence the inquiry of Nathanael,\n“Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?” The evangelists\nsay but very little in regard to the early life of Christ. With the\nexception of a brief account of His accompanying His parents to\nJerusalem, we have the simple statement only, “And the child grew,\nand waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God\nwas upon him.”...\nChildren and youth are frequently situated where their surround-\nings are not favorable to a Christian life, and they quite readily yield\nto temptations and plead as an excuse for pursuing a course of sin\nthat their surroundings are unfavorable....\nChrist placed His feet in the most uneven path that children and\nyouth will ever be called to travel. He did not have allotted to Him a\nlife of affluence and indolence. His parents were poor and dependent\nupon their daily toil for sustenance; therefore the life of Christ was\none ofpoverty, self-denial, andprivation. He sharedwithHis parents\ntheir life of diligent industry.\nNone will ever be called to perfect Christian character under\nmore unfavorable circumstances than that of our Savior. The fact\nthat Christ lived thirty years in Nazareth, from which many thought\nit a wonder if any good thing could come, is a rebuke to the youth\nwho consider that their religious character must conform to circum-\nstances. If the surroundings of youth are unpleasant and positively\nbad, many make this an excuse fornotperfecting Christian character.\nThe example of Christ would rebuke the idea that His followers are\ndependent upon place, fortune, or prosperity in order to live blame-\nless lives. Christ would teach them that their faithfulness would\nJesusWasFromNazareth,August13 493\nmake any place, or position, where the providence of God called\nthem, honorable, however humble....\nThe trials and privations of which so many youth complain,\nChrist endured without murmuring. And this discipline is the very\nexperiencetheyouthneed,whichwillgivefirmnesstotheircharacter\nand make them like Christ, strong in spirit to resist temptation....\nThrough daily prayer to God they will have wisdom and grace from\nHim to bear the conflicts and stern realities of life and come off\nvictorious.—Youth’s Instructor, March 1872.\nAnd the common people heard Him gladly. Mark 12:37.\nChrist passed no human being by as worthless and hopeless, but\nsought to apply the saving remedy to every soul who needed help.\nWhereverHewasfound, Hehadalesson topresentthatwastheright\none for the time and circumstance. He sought to inspire with hope\nthe most rough and unpromising, setting before them the idea that\nthey might become blameless and harmless and attain a character\nthat would be Christlike. They could be the children of God and\nshine as lights in the world, even though they lived among evil\npeople. This was the reason that so many heard Him gladly. From\nHis very childhood He worked for others, letting His light shine\namid the moral darkness of the world. In bearing burdens in His\nhome life and in laboring in more public fields, He showed everyone\nwhat the character of God is. He encouraged everything that had a\nbearing on the real interests of life, but He did not encourage the\nyouth in dreaming of what would be in the future. He taught them\nby His words and by His example that the future would be decided\nby the way in which they spent the present. Our destiny is marked\nout by our own course of action. Those who cherish that which is\nright, who work out God’s plan though it be in a narrow sphere of\naction, and who do right because it is right will find wider fields of\nusefulness....\nIt is our privilege now to act a part in the work and mission\nof Christ. We may be laborers together with Him. In whatever\nwork we are called to engage, we may work with Christ. He is\ndoing all that He can to set us free, to make our lives that seem so\ncramped and narrow reach out to bless and help others. He would\nhave us understand that we are held responsible to do good, and\nhave us realize that in shunning our work we are bringing loss upon\nourselves....\nByWordsandbyExample,August14 495\nJesus carried the burden of the salvation of the human family\nupon His heart. He knew that unless men and women would re-\nceive Him and become changed in purpose and life, they would be\neternally lost. This was the burden of His soul, and He was alone\nin carrying this load. No one knew how heavy was the weight that\nrested upon His heart; but from His youth He was filled with a deep\nlonging to be a lamp in the world, and He purposed that His life\nshould be “the light of the world.” This He was, and that light still\nshines to all who are in darkness. Let us walk in the light which He\nFor we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with\nour weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet\nwithout sin. Hebrews 4:15.\nAs Christ’s ministry was about to begin, He received baptism\nat the hands of John. Coming up out of the water, He bowed on\nthe banks of the Jordan and offered to the Father such a prayer as\nheaven had never before listened to.... The heavens were opened,\nand a dove, in appearance like burnished gold, rested upon Jesus;\nand from the lips of the infinite God were heard the words, “This is\nmy beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”\nThis visible answer to the prayer of God’s Son is of deep signifi-\ncance to us....\nAllmayfindrestandpeaceandassuranceinsendingtheirprayers\nto God in the name of His dear Son.

And when the tempter came to him, he\nsaid, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made\nbread.”...\nAdam had failed on the point of appetite, and Christ must con-\nquer here. The power that rested upon Him came directly from the\nFather, and He must not exercise it in His own behalf.... He met\nand resisted the enemy in the strength of a “Thus saith the Lord.”\n“Man shall not live by bread alone,” He said, “but by every word\nthat proceedeth out of the mouth of God.”...\nChrist’sexperienceisforourbenefit.

Had He not stood as\nour representative, Christ’s innocence would have exempted Him\nfrom all this anguish; but it was because of His innocence that He\nfelt so keenly the assaults of Satan. All the suffering that is the result\nof sin was poured into the bosom of the sinless Son of God. Satan\nwas bruising the heel of Christ, but every pang endured by Christ,\nevery grief, every disquietude, was fulfilling the great plan of our\nredemption.

He next took\nChrist to the pinnacle of the temple at Jerusalem and asked Him to\nprove His Sonship to God by throwing Himself down from the dizzy\nheight. “If thou be the Son of God,” he said, “cast thyself down:\nfor it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee:\nand in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash\nthy foot against a stone.” But to do this would be presumption on\nthe part of Christ, and He would not yield. “It is written again,” He\nreplied, “thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.” Again the tempter\nwas baffled. Christ was victor still.\nPresumption is a common temptation, and when Satan assails us\nwith this, he gains the victory almost every time. Those who claim\nto be enlisted in the warfare against evil frequently plunge without\nthought into temptation from which it would require a miracle to\nbring them forth unsullied. God’s precious promises are not given to\nstrengthen us in a presumptuous course orto relyupon when we rush\nneedlessly into danger. The Lord requires us to move with a humble\ndependence upon His guidance. “It is not in man that walketh to\ndirect his steps.” In God is our prosperity and our life.... “Commit\nthy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to\npass.” As children of God, we are to maintain a consistent Christian\ncharacter.\nWhile you pray... that you may not be led into temptation,\nrememberthatyourworkdoesnotendwithprayer. Asfaraspossible\nyou must answer your own prayers by resisting temptation. Ask\nJesus to do for you that which you cannot do for yourself.

The glorious\nmanifestationsofheavenwerenotentirelyrestrained. Thewonderful\nevent was not without some attestations of a divine character. That\nbirth, so little prepared for on earth, was celebrated in the heavenly\ncourts with praise and thanksgiving in behalf of sinners....\nHe who came in human flesh and submitted to a life of humil-\niation was the Majesty of heaven, the Prince of life, and yet the\nwise men of the earth, the princes and rulers, and even His own\nnation, knew Him not.

        "content": "The factthat the people were more interested in Christ’s teaching\nthan they were in the dry, tedious arguments of the Jewish teachers\nmaddened the scribes and Pharisees. These teachers spoke with\nuncertainty, interpreting the Scriptures to mean one thing and then\nanother. This left the people in great confusion. But as they listened\nto Jesus, their hearts were warmed and comforted. He presented\nGod as a loving Father, not as an avenging judge. He drew all, high\nand low, rich and poor, to see God in His true character, leading\nthem to call Him by the endearing name, “Our Father.”\nBy loving words and by works of mercy, Christ bore down old\ntraditions and man-made commandments and presented the love of\nthe Father in its exhaustless fullness. His calm, earnest, musical\nvoice fell like balm on the wounded spirit. He was revealing the\nimage of God mirrored in Himself. He presented to His hearers the\ntruths of the prophecies, separating them from the obscure interpre-\ntations which the scribes and Pharisees had attached to them. He\nscattered the heavenly grains of truth wherever He went.\nDetermined to hear what Christ said to His disciples, the scribes\nand Pharisees kept spies on His track. These spies noted His words\nand reported them to the Jewish authorities, who, when they heard\nthem, were almost beside themselves with ill-concealed rage, which\nthey interpreted to be zeal for God.\nAs the members of the Sanhedrin counseled together, there were\nnot wanting men with strong, determined prejudices who advised\nthat this man who claimed so much be at once put down....\nThey saw that Christ’s influence over the people was fast be-\ncoming greater than theirs. They longed to crush Him for daring\nto make their traditions of none effect, but they feared to move\nopenly because of the people. They thought that if they worked\nRevealingtheFather,August18 503\nsecretly, watching His words and actions, they would soon find such\naccusations against Him that He could be put on trial for His life....\nChrist was giving the rulers of Israel light which would make\nthem inexcusable. Nothing was left undone that could be done to\n1901.\nBut you do not have His word abiding in you, because whom\nHe sent, Him you do not believe. John 5:38.\nAs at different times during Christ’s work divinity flashed\nthrough humanity and He stood transfigured before the people, the\nJewish leaders were deeply impressed. But as they talked it over\nwith one another, their unbelief strengthened, and the evidence that\nshould have convinced them was rejected. The strongest evidence\nwas no evidence to them, while the weakest, most superficial argu-\nments, if against the truth which the Savior brought, were sound in\ntheir estimation. They had started upon a path leading to eternal\nruin....\nChrist saw that the Jewish teachers misinterpreted the Word of\nGod, and He urged upon them a more diligent study of its precepts.\nIn Him were fast being fulfilled the types and shadows of the Jewish\neconomy. If they searched the Scriptures as they should, they would\nfind that He claimed nothing which was not rightfully His.\nHad the Jews searched God’s Word as they should, they would\nhave seen that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah. But they searched\nwith proud, selfish ambition as a guide, and they found a Messiah of\ntheir own imagination. Therefore when the Savior came, a humble\nman, bringing to naught by His teaching long-established theories\nand traditions, presenting truth entirely opposite to their practices,\nthey said, Who is this invader that dares to set aside our authority?\nChrist did not come as they had expected; therefore they refused to\nreceive Him and called Him a deceiver and an impostor. Instead\nof listening to Him that they might learn the truth, they listened\nwith evil intent, that they might find something over which to cavil.\nAnd when once they had set their feet in the path of the great leader\nin rebellion, it was an easy matter for Satan to strengthen them\nin opposition. Christ’s wonderful works, which God meant to be\nheaven-sent evidence to them, Satan caused them to interpret against\nBlindedbyPrejudice,August19 505\nHim. The more marked the way in which God spoke to them by His\nworks of mercy and love, the more confirmed did they become in\ntheir resistance.

As the paralytic lay beside the\npool, helpless and well-nigh hopeless, Jesus drew near and asked,\nin tones of pity, “Wilt thou be made whole?” Be made whole!\nThis had been the burden of his desire and prayers for long, weary\nyears. With trembling eagerness he told the story of his efforts and\ndisappointments. No friend was at hand to bear him with sturdy\narm into the healing fountain. His agonizing appeals for help fell\nunheeded; all around him were those who sought for their own loved\nones the coveted boon. When at the troubling of the waters he\npainfully sought to reach the pool, another would be hurried down\nbefore him.\nJesus looked upon the sufferer and said, “Rise, take up thy bed,\nand walk.” There was no assurance of divine help, no manifestation\nof miraculous power. What marvel, had the man made answer, “It is\nimpossible! How can I be expected now to use my limbs that have\nnot obeyed my will for thirty-eight years?” From a merely human\nstandpoint, such reasoning would appear consistent. The sufferer\nmight have given place to doubt and thus have permitted that God-\ngiven opportunity to pass unimproved. But no; without a question\nhe seized his only chance.

There was no rejoicing at the deliverance of\nthat long-imprisoned captive, no grateful praise that One was among\nthem who could heal all manner of disease. Their traditions had\nbeen disregarded, and this closed their eyes to all the evidence of\ndivine power.\nBigoted and self-righteous, they would not admit that they could\nhave misapprehended the true design of the Sabbath. Instead of\ncriticizing themselves, they chose to condemn Christ. We meet with\npeople of the same spirit today, who are blinded by error and yet\nflatter themselves that they are right, and all who differ from them\nare in the wrong.\nThe man on whom the miracle had been wrought entered into no\ncontroversy with his accusers. He simply answered, “He that made\nme whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.”...\nWhen the Jews were informed that it was Jesus of Nazareth who\nhad performed the miracle of healing, they openly sought to put\nHim to death, “because he had done these things on the sabbath\nday.” These pretentious formalists were so full of zeal for their own\ntraditions that to sustain them they were ready to violate the law of\nGod!\nTo theircharges, Jesus repliedcalmly,... “I am workingin perfect\nharmony with my Father.” This answer furnished another pretext to\ncondemn Him. Murder was in their hearts, and they waited only for\na plausible excuse to take His life. But Jesus steadily continues to\nassert His true position. “The Son can do nothing of himself, but\nAbundantEvidenceforFaith,August21 509\nwhat he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these\nalso doeth the Son likewise.”...\nGod works through whom He will by ways and means of His\nownchoosing, butthereareeversometoactthepartofthecriticizing\nPharisees....\nGoddesignsthatallshallbelieve,notbecausethereisnopossibil-\nityofdoubt, butbecause there is abundantevidence forfaith.—Signs\nNeither this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of\nGod should be revealed in him. John 9:3.\n“And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from\nhis birth. And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin,\nthis man, or his parents, that he was born blind?”...\nIn the question the disciples asked Jesus, they showed that they\nthought all disease and suffering the result of sin. This is indeed\ntruth, but Jesus showed that it was an error to suppose that everyone\nwho was a great sufferer was also a great sinner. While He corrected\ntheir errors, He spat upon the ground and made clay of the spittle,\nand anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay and said unto\nhim, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation,\nSent),” and he went his way, and came seeing. Jesus answered the\nquestion the disciples put to Him in a practical way, and in the\nway He usually answered questions put to Him from curiosity. The\ndisciples were not called upon to discuss the question of who had\nsinned or not sinned but to understand the power of God, His mercy\nand compassion, in giving sight to the blind. It was that all might be\nconvinced that there was no healing virtue in the clay or in the pool\nwherein he was sent to wash, but that virtue was in Christ....\nThe friends and neighbors of the young man who had been\nhealed looked upon him with doubt, for when his eyes were opened,\nhis countenance had been changed and brightened, and made him\nappear like another man. From one to another the question was\npassed, “Is it he?” And some said, “It is like him,” but he who had\nreceived the great blessing settled the controversy by saying, “I\nam he.” He then told them of Jesus and by what means Jesus had\nhealed him, and they inquired, “Where is he? He said, I know not.\nThey brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. And\nit was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his\neyes.... Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of\nBlindManHealed,August22 511\nGod, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can\na man that is a sinner do such miracles?

He had\nneither rope nor bucket with which to draw, and He waited until\nsomeone should come to the well.

But they are looking far away\nfrom the well that contains the refreshing water, and, though told\nthat the water is close by, they will not believe.\nJesus answered the woman, saying, “If thou knewest the gift of\nGod, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest\nhave asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. The\nwoman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the\nwell is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? Art thou\ngreater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank\nthereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?” Yes, Jesus could\nhave answered, the One who is speaking to you is the only begotten\nSon of God; I am greater than your father Jacob, for before Abraham\nWaterofLife,August23 513\nwas, I am. But He made answer, “Whosoever drinketh of this water\nshall thirst again: but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall\ngive him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall\nbe in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.”...\nChrist was just as truly the water of life to Abel, Seth, Enoch,\nNoah, and all who received His instruction then as He is at the\npresent time to those who ask of Him the refreshing draft.—Signs"

The\nhealing of His divine hand brought gladness and life to the dying\nand ease and health to those suffering with disease. The day seemed\nto them like heaven upon earth, and they were utterly unconscious\nof how long it was since they had eaten anything.\n“And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto\nhim, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:\nsend them away, that they may go into the country round about, and\ninto the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing\nto eat. He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat.”\nSurprised and astonished, they say unto Him, “Shall we go and buy\ntwo hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat? He saith\nunto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they\nknew, they say, Five, and two fishes. And he commanded them\nto make all sit down by companies upon the green grass....

After the wants of all had been supplied, the\ncommand was given, “Gather up the fragments that remain, that\nnothing be lost.” Twelve baskets full were gathered up, and then\nChrist and His disciples ate of the precious, heaven-supplied food....\nIn the place of shifting your responsibility upon someone whom\nyou think more richly endowed than you are, work according to your\nability, even though you have but one talent....\nChrist received from the Father; He imparted to the disciples;\nand they imparted to the multitude.

He was soon to pass through\nscenes that would be to them the severest test. Not only did He see\ndistinctly His own humiliation and suffering, but He saw also the\neffect that this would have upon the disciples. He would not leave\nthem in darkness regarding His future work.... He knew that in their\nsorrow they would be assailed by the enemy, for Satan’s craft is\nmost successful when carried on against those who are depressed by\ndifficulties....\nDuring these last sorrowful hours, Christ told His disciples that\non the night of His trial, they would all be offended because of Him,\nand that He would be left alone. He told them that for a little while\nafter His death they would be sorrowful, but that their sorrow would\nbe turned into joy. He told them that the time was coming when they\nwould be put out of the synagogues, and that those who killed them\nwould think that they were doing God service. He stated plainly why\nHe told them these things while He was yet with them-that when His\nwords were fulfilled, they would remember that He had told them of\nthem before they came to pass, and thus be strengthened to believe\nin Him as their Redeemer....\nChrist’s statements saddened and amazed the disciples. But they\nwere followed by the comforting assurance, “Let not your heart be\ntroubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s\nhouse are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.\nI go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for\nyou, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I\nam, there ye may be also.”...\nJoyofChrist’sFellowshipinHeaven,August27 521\nNot only to the disciples, but to us, are these words of comfort\nspoken. In the last scenes of this earth’s history, war will rage. There\nwill be pestilence, plague, and famine. The waters of the deep will\noverflow their boundaries. Property and life will be destroyed by fire\nand flood. We should be preparing for the mansions that Christ has\ngone to prepare for them that love Him. There is a rest from earth’s\nconflict.

He ascended up\ninto the heavens and is forever set down on the right hand of God.\nChrist’s life on this earth had been a life of toil, a busy, earnest\nlife. He rose from the dead and for forty days remained with His\ndisciples, instructing them preparatory to His departure from them.\nHe was ready for the leave-taking. He had demonstrated the fact\nthat He was a living Savior; His disciples need no longer associate\nHim with the tomb of Joseph. They could think of Him as glorified\namid the heavenly host....\nAll heaven waited with eager earnestness for the end of the\ntarrying of the Son of God in a world all seared and marred with the\ncurse. In proportion to Christ’s humiliation and suffering was to be\nHis exaltation. He became the Savior, the Redeemer, only by first\nbecoming the Sacrifice....\nChrist came to earth as God in the guise of humanity. He as-\ncended to heaven as the King of saints. His ascension was worthy\nof His exalted character. He ascended from the Mount of Olives\nin a cloud of angels, who triumphantly escorted Him to the city of\nGod. Not in His own interest did He go, but as the covenant-making\nRedeemer of His believing sons and daughters, who are made thus\nthrough faith in His name.

They stripped the fields\nof their increase and robbed and maltreated the inhabitants, and then\nreturned to the deserts....\nFor seven years this oppression continued, and then in their\ndistress the people remembered Him who had so often delivered\nthem; and they cried unto the Lord for help....\nTheir prayers were heard, and again the Lord sent forth the man\nof His choice to act as deliverer for Israel. The one thus selected was\nGideon, of the tribe of Manasseh.... It was only with the greatest\ndifficulty that the Hebrews could secrete sufficient food to save them\nfrom actual starvation. Gideon had, however, retained possession of\na small quantity of wheat, and fearing to beat it out in the threshing\nfloor, he had taken it to the vineyard, near the winepress.

When a prophet or an angel delivered a\ndivine message, his words were, “The Lord saith, I will do this,” but\nit is stated of the Person who talked with Gideon, “The Lord said\nunto him, Surely I will be with thee.”\nDesiring to show special honor to his illustrious Visitor, and\nhaving obtained the assurance that the Angel would tarry, Gideon\nhastened to his tent, and out of his scanty store prepared a kid and\nunleavened cakes, which he brought forth to set before Him. Gideon\nwas poor, yet he was ready to use hospitality without grudging.\nAs the gift was presented, the Angel said, “Take the flesh and\nunleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the\nbroth.” Gideon did so, and then the Lord gave him the sign which\nhe desired. With the staff in His hand, the Angel touched the flesh\nand the unleavened cakes, and a fire rose up out of the rock and\nconsumed the whole as a sacrifice, and not as a hospitable meal; for\nHe was God, and not man.

Hence, he asked a renewal\nof the sign, humbly pleading that unbelief might not move the Lord\nto anger.

At the divine command\nthe Hebrew force had been reduced by successive tests until there\nremained with him only three hundred men to oppose that countless\nmultitude. What wonder that his heart sank within him as he thought\nof the conflict of the morrow.\nBut the Lord did not leave His faithful servant to despair. He\nspoke to Gideon in the night season, and bade him, with Phurah, his\ntrusty attendant, go down to the camp of the Midianites, intimating\nthat he would there hear matter for his encouragement. He went,\nand waiting there in darkness and silence, he heard one soldier, just\nawakened, relate a dream to his companion, “Lo, a cake of barley\nbread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and\nsmote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.”\nThe other answered in words that stirred the heart of that unseen\nlistener, “This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of\nJoash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian,\nand all the host.”\nGideon recognized the voice of God speaking to him through\nthe words of these Midianitish strangers.

There are many\nwho think that this love for Christ was something natural to the\ncharacter of John, and the disciple is frequently represented by the\nartist as of a soft, languid, feminine appearance, but such represen-\ntations are incorrect. John and his brother were called the “sons of\nthunder.” John was a man of decided character, but he had learned\nlessons from the great Teacher. He had defects of character, and any\nslight shown to Jesus aroused his indignation and combativeness.\nHis love for Christ was the love of a soul saved through the merits\nof Jesus, but with this love there were natural evil traits that had\nto be overcome.

At another time, when he saw his\nLord slighted by the Samaritans, he wanted to call down fire from\nheaven to consume them. But Christ rebuked him, saying, “The Son\nof man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.”\nIn the character and teaching of Christ, the disciples had both\nprecept and example, and the grace of Christ was a transforming\npower, working marvelous changes in the life of the disciples.

They came not only to see\nJesus, but many were curious to see one who had been raised from\nthe dead. They thought that Lazarus would have some wonderful\nexperience to relate, and were surprised that he told them nothing....\nLazarus had a wonderful testimony to bear, however, in regard to the\nwork of Christ. He had been raised from the dead for this purpose.\nHe was a living testimony to the divine power.

Martha served at the table,\nbut Mary was listening earnestly to every word that fell from the lips\nof Jesus. In His mercy Christ had pardoned Mary’s sins, which had\nbeen many and grievous. Lazarus, her beloved brother, had been\ncalled from the grave and restored to his family by the power of\nthe Savior; and Mary’s heart was filled with gratitude. She longed\nto do Him honor.

If we could understand our own weakness, we should see so\nmuch to do for ourselves that we would humble our hearts under the\nmighty hand of God.

His fallwas notinstantaneous,\nbut gradual. Step after step was taken until the poor, sinful one\ndenied his Lord with cursing and swearing....\nThe crowing of the cock reminded Peter of the words of Christ,\nand, surprised and shocked, he turned and looked at his Master.\nAt that moment Christ looked at Peter, and beholding that grieved\nlook, in which compassion and love for him were blended, Peter\nunderstoodhimself. Withstartlingvividnesshisself-confidentwords\nflashed upon his mind, “Although all shall be offended, yet will not\nI.” “I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.” And\nyet he had denied his Lord with cursing and swearing!\nBut Peter was not left in hopelessness. The look that Christ had\ngiven him brought a ray of hope to the erring disciple. He read there\nthe words, “Peter, I am sorry for you. Because you are sorry and\nrepent, I forgive you.” While Peter’s soul was passing through such\ndeep humiliation, through the awful struggle with satanic agencies,\nhe remembered the words of Christ, “I have prayed for thee,” and\nthey were to him a precious assurance....\nIn Peter’s fallwe have before us ourown individualcases.

The other, given because of Adam’s transgression of the moral\nlaw, the obedience to which consisted in sacrifices and offerings\npointing to the future redemption....\nThe love that God bore to humanity, whom He had created in His\nown image, led Him to give His Son to die for their transgression,\nand lest the increase of sin should lead them to forget God and\nthe promised redemption, the system of sacrificial offerings was\nestablished to typify the perfect offering of the Son of God....\nChrist became sin for the fallen race in taking upon Himself the\ncondemnation resting upon the sinner for his transgression of the\nlaw of God. Christ stood at the head of the human family as their\nrepresentative. He had taken upon Himself the sins of the world.

The feeblest intellect can\ngrasp these rules to regulate the life and form the character after the\ndivine Model....\nThe infinite sacrifice which Christ has made to magnify and exalt\nthe law testifies that not one jot or tittle of that law will relinquish\nits claims upon the transgressor. Christ came to pay the debt which\nthe sinner had incurred by transgression, and by His own example to\nteach us how to keep the law of God. Said Christ, “I have kept my\nFather’s commandments.” In consideration of all the facts so clearly\nestablishing the claims of God’s law, with heaven and eternal life\nin view to inspire hope and induce effort, it is inconceivable how\nso many professing to be servants of God can set aside His law and\nteach sinners that they are not amenable to its precepts. What a fatal\ndelusion! Satan first devised this heresy, and by it he enticed Eve\ninto sin. The sad results of that transgression are before us....\nChrist came to teach us the way of salvation. And when the\nshadowy services of the former dispensation were no longer of any\nvalue-when type had met antitype in the death of Christ-then we\nmight expect that if the law of ten commandments were no longer\nbinding, Christ would declare its abrogation.

In awful majesty, amid thundering and\nlightning, He proclaimed from Mount Sinai His ten holy precepts....\nGod saw the sinner’s hopeless condition. He looked with sor-\nrow upon the world, which was steadily growing more and more\ndegraded and sinful. He could not change His law to meet our defi-\nciencies; for He says, “My covenant will I not break, nor alter the\nthing thatis gone outofmy lips.” Butin His greatlove forthe human\nrace, in His desire that we should not be left to meet the penalty of\nour transgression, but that we should be elevated and ennobled, He\n“gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should\nnot perish, but have everlasting life.” Christ laid aside His royal\nrobes and came to this earth, bringing with Him a power sufficient\nto overcome sin. He came to live the law of God in humanity, that\nby partaking of His divine nature, we also might live that law....\nBefore the universe of heaven, before the fallen angels, and\nbefore those whom He had come to save, Christ lived the law of\nGod. By His supreme obedience to its requirements, He exalted and\nenforced it. By His purity, goodness, beneficence, devotion, and zeal\nfor the glory of God, by His unsurpassed love for others, He made\nknown the perfection of the law.

Those who are loyal to the truth will, through\nthe merits of Christ, overcome all weakness of character which has\nled them to be molded by every varying circumstance of life.\nMany have taken the position that they cannot sin because they\nare sanctified, but this is a delusive snare of the evil one.

Some learn these important lessons more easily\nthan do others, for they are exercised by the simple discipline the\nLord gives them in gentleness and love. Others require the slow\ndiscipline of suffering, that the cleansing fire may purify their hearts\nof pride and self-reliance, of earthly passion and self-love, that the\ntrue gold of character may appear, and that they may become victors\nthrough the grace of Christ. The love of God will strengthen the\nsoul, and through the virtue of the merits of the blood of Christ we\nmay stand unscathed amid the fire of temptation and trial; but no\nother help can avail to save but Christ, our righteousness, who is\nmade unto us wisdom and sanctification and redemption.\nTrue sanctification is nothing more or less than to love God\nwith all the heart, to walk in His commandments and ordinances\nblameless. Sanctification is not an emotion, but a heaven-born\nprinciple that brings all the passions and desires under the control\nof the Spirit of God; and this work is done through our Lord and\nSavior.\nSpurious sanctification does not glorify God, but leads those\nwho claim it to exalt and glorify themselves. Whatever comes in our\nexperience, whether of joy or sorrow, that does not reflect Christ and\npoint to Him as its author,... is not true Christian experience.\nWhen the grace of Christ is implanted in the soul by the Holy\nSpirit, its possessor will become humble in spirit and will seek for\nthe society of those whose conversation is upon heavenly things.\nThen the Spirit will take the things of Christ and show them unto us,\nand will glorify, not the receiver, but the Giver.

Your prayers, the discharge of\nyour duty, your benevolence, your self-denial, will not be the theme\nof your thought or conversation, but you will magnify Him who\ngave Himself for you when you were yet a sinner. You will say, “I\ngive myself to Jesus.

The peace of Christ\nis an intelligent peace, and it does not make those who possess it\nbear the marks of fanaticism and extravagance. It is not a rambling\nimpulse, but an emanation from God. When the Savior imparts His\npeace to the soul, the heart will be in perfect harmony with the Word\nof God, for the Spirit and the Word agree. The Lord honors His\nWord in all His dealings with humanity. It is His own will, His own\nvoice, that is revealed to them, and He has no new will, no new\ntruth, aside from His Word to unfold to His children. If you have\na wonderful experience that is not in harmony with the expressed\ndirections of God’s Word, you may well doubt it; for its origin is not\nfrom above. The peace of Christ comes through the knowledge of\nJesus whom the Bible reveals.\nIf happiness is drawn from outside sources and not from the\nDivine Fount, it will be as changeable as varying circumstances can\nmake it; but the peace of Christ is a constant and abiding peace.\nIt does not depend on any circumstance in life, on the amount of\nworldly goods, or the number of earthly friends. Christ is the foun-\ntain of living waters, and happiness and peace drawn from Him\nwill never fail, for He is a wellspring of life. Those who trust in\nHim can say, “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in\ntrouble.”...\nWe have reason for ceaseless gratitude to God that Christ, by His\nperfect obedience, has won back the heaven that Adam lost through\ndisobedience.

        "content": "God reveals Christ to sinners, and they behold Him dying upon\nCalvary for the sin of His creatures. They then understand how they\nare condemned by the law of God, for the Spirit works upon their\nconsciences, enforcing the claim of the broken law. They are then\ngiven the opportunity of defying the law, of rejecting the Savior,\nor of yielding to its claims and receiving Christ as their Redeemer.\nGod will not compel the service of sinners, but He reveals to them\ntheir obligation, unfolds to them the requirements of His holy law,\nand sets before them the result of their choice-to obey and live, or to\ndisobey and perish.\nThe command from heaven is, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy\nGodwithallthyheart, andwithallthysoul, andwithallthystrength,\nand with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.” When the force\nof this requirement is understood, the conscience is convicted, the\nsinner is condemned. The carnal mind, which is not subject to the\nlaw of God, neither indeed can be, rises up in rebellion against\nthe holy claims of the law. But as sinners behold Christ hanging\nupon the cross of Calvary, suffering for their transgression, deeper\nconviction takes hold upon them, and they see something of the\noffensive nature of sin.\nWhere there is a true conception of the spirituality and holiness\nof the divine law, sinners are under condemnation, and their sins\nstand arrayed before them in their true character. By the law is the\nknowledge of sin, and in its light they understand the evil of secret\nthoughts and deeds of darkness....\nCharacter is tested and registered by Heaven more by the inward\nspirit, the hidden motives, than by that which appears to others. Peo-\nple may have a pleasing exterior and be outwardly excellent, while\nthey are but whited sepulchers, full of corruption and uncleanness.\nBeHonestWithGod,October16 625\nTheir works are registered as unsanctified, unholy. Their prayers and\nworks, devoid of the righteousness of Christ, do not ascend before\nGod as sweet fragrance, but they are abomination in the eyes of the\nLord. To those who will open their eyes, the law presents a perfect\nlikeness of the soul, a complete photograph of the inner being; and\nas this picture is unveiled before sinners, they are constrained to\nacknowledge that they are sold under sin, but that the law is holy,\nThe Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of\nwisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might,\nthe Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord. Isaiah 11:2.\n“If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.”... We\ncannot spiritually discern the character of God or accept of Jesus\nChrist by faith unless our life and character are marked by purity, by\nthe casting down of imaginations and of every high thing that exalts\nitself against the knowledge of God, and by bringing into captivity\nevery thought to the obedience of Christ....\nThe Lord is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to them that\nearnestly desire it than are earthly parents to give good gifts to their\nchildren. Christ has promised the Holy Spirit to guide us unto all\ntruth and righteousness and holiness. The Holy Spirit is not given\nby measure to those who earnestly seek for it, who by faith stand\nupon the promises of God. They plead the pledged word of God,\nsaying, “Thou hast said it. I take thee at thy word.”\nThe Comforter is given that He may take of the things of Christ\nand show them unto us, that He may present in their rich assurance\nthe words that fell from His lips and convey them with living power\nto the soul who is obedient, who is emptied of self. It is then that\nthe soul receives the image and superscription of the divine. Then\nJesus Christ is formed within, the hope of glory....\nFood is the substance of which we partake, that our bodies may\nbe strengthened and built up. In like manner we are to feed upon that\nwhich will build up our spiritual nature. Jesus said, “It is the spirit\nthat quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak\nunto you, they are spirit, and they are life.” Our bodies are composed\nof that upon which we feed; so our spiritual life will be composed of\nthat upon which we feed. If we feed on Christ, by thinking of Him,\nby obeying His words, we are built up in Him and grow in grace\nGuidedbytheHolySpirit,October17 627\nand in the knowledge of the truth unto the full stature of men and\nwomen in Christ Jesus....\nAs God works in us to will, we are to cooperate with God,\nmanifesting a determination like that of Daniel to do the will of God,\nworking in harmony with the divine Agent. Then we shall have rest"

The disciples rallied; their hopelessness\nand helplessness left them. They were transformed in character,\nand united in bonds of Christian love. They were but humble men,\nwithout wealth and with no weapon but the Word and Spirit of God,\ncounted by the Jews as mere fishermen. Yet in Christ’s strength\nthey went forth to witness for the truth and to triumph over all\nopposition.

Men possessed of\ndemons are taking the lives of men and women and little children.\nAll these things testify that the coming of Christ is near at hand.\nThe doctrine that men and women are released from obedience\nto God’s requirements has weakened the force of moral obligation\nand opened the floodgates of iniquity upon the world....\nCourts of justice are corrupt. Rulers are actuated by a desire for\ngain and love of sensual pleasure. Intemperance has beclouded the\nfaculties of many, so that Satan has almost complete control of them.\nJurists are perverted, bribed, deluded. Drunkenness and revelry,\npassion, envy, dishonesty of every sort, are represented among those\nwho administer the laws. “Justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen\nin the street, and equity cannot enter.” People are rushing on in the\nmad race for gain and selfish indulgence as if there were no God, no\nheaven, and no hereafter....\nThe “time of trouble, such as never was,” is soon to open upon\nus, and we shall need an experience which many are too indolent to\nobtain. It is often the case that trouble is greater in anticipation than\nin reality, but this is not true of the crisis before us. The most vivid\npresentation cannot reach the magnitude of the ordeal. In that trial\nall must stand for themselves before God....\nNow, while our great High Priest is making the atonement for us,\nwe should seek to become perfect in Christ.

This is the condition in which\nthose must be found who shall stand in the time of trouble.—The\nAnd God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall\nbe no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no\nmore pain, for the former things have passed away. Revelation\n21:4.\nIn the darkest days of her long conflict with evil, the church of\nthe living God has been given revelations of the eternal purpose\nof Jehovah. His people have been permitted to look beyond the\ntrials of the present to the triumphs of the future, when, the warfare\nhaving been accomplished, the redeemed will enter into possession\nof the Promised Land. These visions of future glory, scenes pictured\nby the hand of God, should be dear to His church today, when the\ncontroversy of the ages is rapidly closing and the promised blessings\nare soon to be realized in all their fullness....\nOften the church militant is called upon to suffer trial and afflic-\ntion, for not without severe conflict is the church to triumph. “The\nbread of adversity, and the water of affliction.” are the common lot\nof all; but none who put their trust in the One mighty to deliver will\nbe utterly overwhelmed....\nClad in the armor of Christ’s righteousness, the church is to\nenter upon her final conflict. “Fair as the moon, clear as the sun,\nand terrible as an army with banners,” she is to go forth into all the\nworld, conquering and to conquer.\nThe darkest hour of the church’s struggle with the powers of evil\nis that which immediately precedes the day of her final deliverance.\nBut none who trust in God need fear....\nTo us who are standing on the very verge of their fulfillment, of\nwhat deep moment, what living interest, are these delineations of the\nthings to come-events for which, since our first parents turned their\nsteps from Eden, God’s children have watched and waited, longed\nand prayed!...\nFastenYourEyesontheFuture,October30 653\nThe nations of the saved will know no other law than the law of\nheaven.

Luke 21:36.\nIn the solemn language of this scripture, a duty is pointed out\nwhich lies in the daily pathway of everyone, whether old or young.\nThis is the duty of watchfulness, and upon our faithfulness here our\ndestiny for time and for eternity depends.\nWe are living in an important time. When in 1844 the message\nwas proclaimed, “Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of\nhis judgment is come,” that announcement stirred every soul to its\nvery depths. A deep solemnity rested upon all who heard it. How\nearnest we were to show our faith by our works and to have our\nwords and actions make a favorable impression on the world....\nToday angels are watching the development of character, and\nsoon our lives will have to pass in review before God. Soon we shall\nbe weighed in the balances of the sanctuary, and over against our\nnames will be recorded the judgment rendered. And we shall receive\nthe crowning gift of eternal life or be punished with everlasting\ndestruction from the presence of the Lord. We may be unwilling to\nexamine ourselves closely now to see what our spiritual condition is\nand whether our hearts are being suitably impressed by the testing\nmessage of truth; but that will not make any difference with the work\nof the judgment. Its decisions will be rendered just the same....\n“Watch ye therefore, and pray always.” There is great need of\nwatchfulness, not for our own sakes only, but also for the sake of our\ninfluence upon others. Our influence is far-reaching. We may think\nthat it is confined to our own households; that only the members of\nour own families know what we are and what we are doing. In some\ncases this may seem to be true; but in some way the influence of the\nhome life goes out beyond the home....\nIf we would share in the glorious reward promised to the over-\ncomer, we must fight the good fight of faith. This is what the apostle\nPaul did, and he says, “Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown\nDivineCommand,October31 655\nof righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me\nat that day.” Let us be of the number of those that are “rich in good\nworks,” “laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against\nthe time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.”—Signs of\n656 FromtheHeart\nNovember"

He has His\nloyal, chosen people. They do not make this world their home, but\nthey are here to witness for God, and as long as probation lasts, a\nliving witness will be borne by these faithful messengers....\nBy the mighty cleaver of truth, God has separated a people from\nthe quarry of the world and brought them into His workshop. Here\nthe Master Worker can successfully hew them with ax and chisel,\nand polish them for a place in His kingdom. No longer are they like\nthe mass from which they were taken. They stand like noble pillars,\nto be used for God’s glory.\nThe future glory of the adopted sons and daughters of God is not\nnow discerned. By the world God’s people are scorned and despised.\nBut they have the sympathies of a better world than this, even a\nheavenly....\nThe Word of God, just as it reads, is the ground of our faith. That\nWord is the sure word of prophecy, and it demands implicit faith\nfrom all who claim to believe it. It is authoritative, containing in\nitself the proof of its divine origin....\nWhat are we who claim to be one with Christ? “We are labourers\ntogether with God.” Between the true believer and the unbeliever\nthere will ever be the same conflict that there was between Christ\nand those who rejected Him. Those who are partakers with Christ\nin His sufferings will also be partakers with Him in His glory. But\nthose who evade the cross here deny Him who has bought them at an\ninfinite price, and in the day of judgment they will be denied. Many,\nChosenofGod,November1 659\nmany, are misrepresenting and denying Christ by their low standard\nof Christianity. Those who truly believe in Christ will show their\nfaith by a well-ordered life and godly conversation. By working in\nChrist’s lines, they will show that they have been adopted into the\nfamily of heaven. Of all such God says, “I will dwell in the high and\nholy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to\nrevive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite\nWho gave Himself for us, that He might... purify for Himself\nHis own special people, zealous for good works. Titus 2:14.\nThe Lord hath set apart them that are godly for Himself, and\nthis consecration to God and separation from the world are plainly\ndeclaredandpositivelyenjoinedinboththeOldandNewTestaments.\nThere is a wall of separation which the Lord Himself has established\nbetween the things of the world and the things He has chosen out of\nthe world and sanctified unto Himself. The calling and the character\nof God’s people are peculiar. Their prospects are peculiar, and these\npeculiarities distinguish them from all people. All of God’s people\nupon the earth are one body, from the beginning to the end of time.\nThey have one Head that directs and governs the body. The same\ninjunctions rest upon God’s people now, to be separate from the\nworld, as rested upon ancient Israel. The great Head of the church\nhas not changed. The experience of Christians in these days is much\nlike the travels of ancient Israel....\nAs we read the Word of God, how plain that God’s people are\npeculiar and distinct from the unbelieving world around them. Our\nposition is interesting and fearful; living in the last days, how im-\nportant that we imitate the example of Christ and walk even as He\nwalked....\nThe servants of Christ have not their home or their treasure here.\nWould that all of them could understand that it is only because the\nLord reigns that we are even permitted to dwell in peace and safety\namong our enemies. It is not our privilege to claim special favors of\nthe world. We must consent to be poor and despised in this world\nuntil the warfare is finished and the victory won. The members of\nChrist are called to come out and be separate from the friendship\nand spirit of the world, and their strength and power consist in their\nbeing chosen and accepted of God....\nPeculiarPeople,November2 661\nEven so the members of Christ are as He was in this world. They\nare the sons and daughters of God and joint heirs with Christ, and\nthe kingdom and dominion belong to them. The world understand\nnot their character and holy calling. They perceive not their adoption\ninto the family of God. Their union and fellowship with the Father\nand the Son are not manifest to the world, and while they behold\ntheir humiliation and reproach, it does not appear what they shall be.\nThey are strangers. The world knows them not and appreciates not\n1875.\nYou shall be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty. 2\nCorinthians 6:18.\nI have been bidden to call the attention of our people to the\ninstruction given by the Lord to Israel regarding the importance of\nseparation from the world....\nUnder David’s rule, the people of Israel gained strength and\nuprightness through obedience to God’s law. But the kings that\nfollowed strove for self-exaltation....\nGod bore long with them, calling them often to repentance. But\nthey refused to hear, and at last God spoke in judgment, showing\nthem how weak they were without Him. He saw that they were\ndetermined to have their own way, and He gave them into the hands\nof their enemies....\nThe alliances made by the Israelites with their heathen neigh-\nbors resulted in the loss of their identity as God’s peculiar people.\nThey became leavened by the evil practices of those with whom they\nformed forbidden alliances. Affiliation with worldlings caused them\nto lose their first love and their zeal for God’s service. The advan-\ntages they sold themselves to gain brought only disappointment and\ncaused the loss of many souls.\nThe experience of Israel will be the experience of all who go\nto the world for strength, turning away from the living God. Those\nwho forsake the mighty One, the source of all strength, and affiliate\nwith worldlings, placing on them their dependence, become weak in\nmoral power, as are those in whom they trust.\nGod comes with entreaties and assurances to those who are\nmaking mistakes. He seeks to show them their error and lead them\nto repentance. But if they refuse to humble their hearts before Him,\nif they strive to exalt themselves above Him, He must speak to them\nin judgment. No semblance of nearness to God, no assertion of\nSeparationFromtheWorld,November3 663\nconnection with Him, will be accepted from those who persist in\ndishonoring Him by leaning upon the arm of worldly power.\nToday God’s word to His people is: “Come out from among\nthem, and be ye separate,... and touch not the unclean thing; and I\nwill receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my\nsons and daughters.”...\nGod’s people are to be distinguished as a people who serve Him\nfully, wholeheartedly, taking no honor to themselves, and remem-\nbering that by a most solemn covenant they have bound themselves\nto serve the Lord, and Him only.—The Review and Herald, August\n4, 1904.\nHallow My Sabbaths, and they will be a sign between Me and\nyou, that you may know that I am the Lord your God. Ezekiel\n20:20.\n“The Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto the\nchildren of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it\nis a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye\nmay know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you.”...\nDo not these words point us out as God’s denominated people?\nAnd do they not declare to us that so long as time shall last we are to\ncherish the sacred, denominational distinction placed on us?... The\nSabbath has lost none of its meaning. It is still the sign between God\nand His people, and it will be so forever....\nGod is testing His people to see who will be loyal to the prin-\nciples of His truth. Our work is to proclaim to the world the first,\nsecond, and third angels’ messages. In the discharge of our duty, we\nare neither to despise nor fear our enemies. To bind ourselves up by\ncontracts or in partnerships or business associations with those not\nof our faith is not in the order of God. We are to treat with kindness\nand courtesy those who refuse to be loyal to God, but we are never,\nnever to unite with them in counsel regarding the vital interests of\nHis work....\nPutting our trust in God, we are to move steadily forward, doing\nHisworkwithunselfishness,... committingourselvesandourpresent\nand future to His wise providence, holding the beginning of our\nconfidence firm unto the end, remembering that it is not because of\nour worthiness that we receive the blessings of heaven, but because\nof the worthiness of Christ and our acceptance, through faith in Him,\nof God’s abounding grace.\nI praythatmybrethren mayrealize thatthe thirdangel’s message\nmeans much to us, and that the observance of the true Sabbath is to\nbe the sign that distinguishes those who serve God from those who\nGod’sPeopleIdentified,November4 665\nserve Him not.... We are called to be holy, and we should carefully\navoid giving the impression that it is of little consequence whether\nor not we retain the peculiar features of our faith. Upon us rests\nthe solemn obligation of taking a more decided stand for truth and\nrighteousnessthanwehavetakeninthepast.

They must be modeled after the divine\npattern....\nIn the work of saving souls, we are to know whereof we speak.\nThe words ofJohn are fullofsignificance when he says, “Thatwhich\nwe have seen and heard declare we unto you.”...\nWhen your soul is the temple for the indwelling Spirit of the\nSavior, the gross elements of your nature will be consumed, and\nthe whole being will become a living purpose. Whoever is truly\nChrist’s will have an experience like that of Daniel, and the fruits\nof the Spirit will appear in the life. There are powers within us that\nare paralyzed through sin, that need the vivifying influence of the\ngrace of Christ, that they may be restored. A mighty power from\nthe Life Giver must quicken them to life and rouse them to action.\nWhen this is your experience, you can work as Jesus has given you\nan example. Divine light and love will be reflected upon those who\nfeel that they are sick in both soul and body. Jesus invites His own\npresence to your soul. He says, “Behold, I stand at the door, and\nknock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in\nto him, and sup with him, and he with me.” Shall we not open the\ndoor of our hearts to the divine Guest?\nThose who engage in the work of God must be pure in heart and\ncircumspect in deportment. The souls of God’s people should not be\nlike a barren waste, as are so many souls at this time. God has given\nto everyone some ability to use in His service, and it is God’s design\nSomeoneIsattheDoor,November9 675\nthat it should be employed to His glory and the good of others. Many\nare losing much, simply because they will not learn in the school of\nChrist. They might gain eternal treasure, but, in turning away from\nthe divine Teacher, their consciences are violated and seared, and\nthe admonitions of God’s Word lose all power to stir their hearts.\nBut there is no need of making such a failure. Christ will come into\nthe heart and abide there if you will but cleanse the soul temple of\nHoly Father, keep through Your name those whom You have\ngiven Me, that they may be one as We are. John 17:11.\nThe Holy Spirit will work with the consecrated human instru-\nment, for this is God’s purpose. God has opened a door between\nheaven and earth which no power can close.... When God’s peo-\nple place themselves in proper relation to Him and to one another,\nthere will be a full impartation of the Holy Spirit for the harmonious\ncombination of the whole body.\nNothing so manifestly weakens a church as disunion and strife.\nNothing so wars against Christ and the truth as this spirit....\nWe can be united with one another only as we are united with\nChrist.... Many who have dwelt much upon doctrinal subjects, but\nwho have not learned of Christ, have been found unable to control\nthemselves. They need the Holy Spirit’s power. We should seek to\nunderstand what it means to be in complete union with Christ, who\nis the propitiation for our sins and for the sins of the whole world.\nOur life should be bound up with His life....\nWhen God’s chosen people are of one mind, barriers of selfish-\nness will disappear as by magic, and many, many more souls will be\nconverted because of the unity which exists among believers. There\nis one body and one spirit. Those who have been building territorial\nlines of distinction, barriers of color and caste, might better take\nthese down much faster than they put them up.\nThose in whose hearts Christ abides recognize Christ abiding in\nthe hearts of others. Christ never wars against Christ. Christ never\nexerts an influence against Christ. Christians are to do their work,\nwhatever it may be, in the unity of the Spirit, for the perfecting of\nthe whole body. The church is to be purified, refined, ennobled. The\nmembers are to cast from their hearts the idols which have hindered\ntheir advancement in spirituality. By the influence of the Spirit,\nthe most discordant may be brought into harmony.

We have very uncertain views of the great mercy and\nloving-kindness of God. He is full of compassion and forgiveness\nand freely pardons when we truly repent and confess our sins.... We\nmust bring into our characters the love and sympathy expressed in\nChrist’s life....\nIf we have received the gift of God and have a knowledge of\nJesus Christ, we have a work to do for others. We must imitate the\nlong-suffering of God toward us. The Lord requires of us the same\ntreatment toward His followers that we receive of Him. We are to\nexercise patience and to be kind, even though they do not meet our\nexpectations. The Lord expects us to be pitiful and loving, to have\nsympathetic hearts. He desires us to show the fruits of the grace\nof God in our deportment one to another. Christ did not say, You\nmay tolerate your neighbor, but, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as\nthyself.” This means a great deal more than professing Christians\ncarry out in their daily life....\nChrist proceeds to teach that the principles of God’s law reach\neven to the intents and purposes of the mind. And He plainly states\nthat if we faithfully keep the ten precepts, we shall love our neighbor\nas ourselves....\nA consistent religious life, holy conversation, a godly example,\ntrue-hearted benevolence, mark the representatives of Christ. They\nwill labor to pluck sinners as brands from the burning; they will\nperform every duty faithfully. Thus they will become a beacon light.\nForgivenessIsNotImpossible,November21 699\nReader, we are nearing the judgment. Talents have been lent us\non trust. Let none of us be at last condemned as slothful servants.\nSend forth the words of life to those in darkness. Let the church\nbe true to her trust.

Acts 13:44.\nThe message of the third angel of Revelation 14 is now to be\nproclaimed not only in lands far off, but in neglected places close\nby, where multitudes dwell unwarned and unsaved. God is calling\nHis people at this time to a long-delayed work. Decided efforts are\nto be made to enlighten those who have never yet been warned. The\nwork in the cities is now to be regarded as of special importance.\nLet workers be carefully selected to labor two and two in the cities\nin harmony with the counsel of experienced leaders and under the\ndirection and commission of Jesus Christ.\nGod desires His people to labor in perfect harmony in an effort\nto carry the truth into the cities. I am bidden to keep this matter\nbefore the attention of the believers until they shall be aroused to a\nrealization of its importance. Let not ill-advised lips utter words of\ndiscouragement, but let everyone in responsibility unite in planning\nfor the accomplishment of this work, knowing that He who has\nled His servants hitherto will not fail them in this time of special\nneed. Angels of God will go before the workers and will be their\nsufficiency. Angels will be in the assemblies to make an impression\nupon the hearts of the hearers....\nThe labors of the apostles in the early Christian church were\ncharacterized by wonderful manifestations of the power of God in\nthe lives of the believers. Through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit,\nmultitudes were brought to a knowledge of the truth as it is in Christ\nJesus. The needs of the world today are no less than they were in\nthe days of the apostles. Those who labor for souls in these times\nof impenitence and unbelief must yield themselves wholly to God,\nand work in unison with heavenly intelligences.

The exalta-\ntion of nature as God, the unrestrained license of the human will, the\ncounsel of the ungodly-these Satan uses as agencies to bring about\ncertain ends. He will employ the power of mind on mind to carry\nout his designs. The most sorrowful thought of all is that under his\ndeceptive influence men and women will have a form of godliness\nwithout having a real connection with God.

I am amazed as I consider the past, present, and future\nof the people of God. The Lord will have a pure, holy people-a\npeople who will stand the test. All believers need now to search\ntheir hearts as with a lighted candle....\nBefore us is held out the wonderful possibility of being like\nChrist-obedient to all the principles of the law of God. But of\nourselves we are utterly powerless to attain to this condition. All\nthat is good in us comes to us through Christ. The holiness that\nGod’s Word declares we must have before we can be saved is the\nresult of the working of divine grace as we bow in submission to the\ndiscipline and restraining influence of the Spirit of truth....\nThe work of transformation from unholiness to holiness is a\ncontinuous work. Day by day God labors for our sanctification, and\nwe are to cooperate with Him by putting forth persevering efforts in\nthe cultivation of right habits. The way in which we are to work out\nour own salvation is plainly specified in the first chapter of Second\nPeter. Constantly we are to add grace to grace, and as we do this,\nGod will work for us upon the plan of multiplication.

He is well pleased when we urge past mercies and\nHolyPeople,November25 707\nblessings as a reason why He should bestow on us higher and greater\nblessings. He is honored when we love Him and bear testimony to\nthe genuineness of our love by keeping His commandments. He is\nhonored when we set apart the seventh day as sacred and holy. To\nthose who do this, the Sabbath is a sign, “that they might know,”\nGod declares, “that I am the Lord that sanctify them.” Sanctification\nmeans habitual communion with God. There is nothing so great\nand powerful as God’s love for those who are His children.—The\nAnd He is the head of the body, the church, who is the\nbeginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He\nmight have the preeminence.

In Christ He gave to them the riches of\nHis grace and a knowledge of His will....\nThe church is yet militant in a world that is apparently in mid-\nnight darkness, and growing worse and worse. While the require-\nments of a plain “Thus saith the Lord” remain unheeded by the\nworldly element in the church, the voices of God’s faithful servants\nare to be strengthened to give the solemn message of warning. The\nworks that should characterize the church militant and the works of\nthe church that has had the light of truth for this time do not corre-\nspond. The Lord calls upon church members to clothe themselves\nwith the beautiful garments of Christ’s righteousness....\nGod needs men and women who will work in the simplicity of\nChrist to bring the knowledge of truth before those who need its\nconverting power. The message of Christ’s righteousness must be\nproclaimed from one end of the earth to the other. Our people are\nto be aroused to prepare the way of the Lord.

They will not\nstudy how best they can preserve their own dignity, but by care\nand thoughtfulness will seek to win the hearts of those whom they\nserve....\nThe apostle Paul urges upon us the advantages placed within\nour reach. “Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved,” he\nsays, “let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and\nspirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” We are to separate\nfrom the world in spirit and practice if we would become sons and\ndaughters of God. In His prayer for His followers, Christ asked, “I\npray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou\nshouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the world, even\nas I am not of the world. Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word\nis truth.”\nThere is earnest work before each one of us. Right thoughts,\npure and holy purposes, do not come to us naturally. We shall\nhave to strive for them.... Those who are under the control of the\nSpirit of God will not seek their own pleasure or amusement.

This building is to be the light of the\nworld. It is to be composed of living stones laid close together, stone\nfitting to stone, making a solid building. All these stones are not of\nthe same shape or dimension. Some are large and some are small,\nbut each one has it own place to fill. In the whole building there is\nnot to be one misshapen stone.

Appropriate duties are assigned by Heaven to the\nchurch on earth, and the members are to find their happiness in the\nhappiness of those whom they help and bless.\nThrough the ages of moral darkness, through centuries of strife\nand persecution, the church of Christ has been as a city set on a\nhill. From age to age, through successive generations, to the present\ntime, the pure doctrines of the Bible have been unfolding within her\nborders. The church of Christ, enfeebled and defective as she may\nappear, is the one object on earth on which He bestows in a special\nsense His love and regard.

But in order that the church may be an educating power\nin the world, she must cooperate with the church in heaven. Her\nmembers must represent Christ.

As they receive\nthis light, they will be enabled to receive and impart more and more\nof the rays of the Sun of Righteousness.\nThere is need of a higher grade of spirituality in the church.\nThere is need of heart purification.

When they come in contact with wrong principles, they\nplant their feet firmly upon the words, “It is written.”...\nThe church today needs laborers who, like Enoch, walk with\nGod, revealing Christ to the world. Church members need to reach\na higher standard.... Our views of the Sun of Righteousness are\nclouded by self-seeking.

Hebrews 11:16.\nAs the [railroad] cars bore our company into the city of Den-\nver, we were charmed in beholding one of the beautiful sunsets of\nColorado. The sun was passing behind the snowcapped mountains,\nleaving its softened beams of golden light to tint the heavens. As\nthe blending tints were deepening and extending athwart the skies,\nwith indescribable beauty, it seemed the gates of heaven were ajar to\nlet the gleamings of its glory through. The golden hues were every\nmoment more and more entrancing, as if to invite our imagination\nto picture the greater glory within.... If this so charms our senses,\nwhat must be the fullness of the glory in heaven itself....\nHeaven seemed very near.... As the eye was turned from the\ndazzling glories of the closing day, we could but reflect that should\nwe see more of heaven by the eye of faith, greater light, more peace\nand joy, would be all along life’s pathway.... If the eye of faith were\nuplifted to see through the veil of the future and discern the tokens\nof God’s love and glory in the promised life beyond, we should be\nmore spiritually minded, and the beauties and joys of heaven would\nmingle with our daily life. We should be fitting up for the faithful\nperformance of our work in this life, and for the higher life beyond....\nOur heavenly Father has hung out glories in the firmament of the\nheavens, that we may have an expression of His love in the revealing\nof His wondrous works. God would not have us indifferent to the\nsymbols of the glories of His infinite power in the heavens. David\ndelighted to dwell upon these glories. He composed psalms which\nthe Hebrew singers chanted to the praise of God. “The heavens de-\nclare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork....\nIn them hathhe seta tabernacle forthe sun, whichis as a bridegroom\nColoradoSunset,December1 721\ncoming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a\nrace.”...\nAll the powers of our being, every means of our existence and\nhappiness, all the blessings of the warm sunshine and the refreshing\nshowers, causing vegetation to flourish, every comfort and every\nblessing of this life, come from God.

John\n1:6.\nThe birth of John the Baptist had been foretold by prophets, and\nan angel was sent to notify Zacharias of the event. The heavenly\nmessenger expressly enjoined upon the father to bring up the child\nwith strictly temperate habits....\nJohn did not feel strong enough to stand the great pressure of\ntemptation he would meet in mingling with society. He feared his\ncharacter would be molded according to the prevailing customs of\nthe Jews, and he chose to separate himself from the world and make\nthe wilderness his home.... So far from being lonely, gloomy, or\nmorose, he enjoyed his life of simplicity and retirement, and his\ntemperate habits kept all his senses unperverted....\nJohn had a special work to do for God. He was to deal with the\nsins and follies of the people. In order to be fitted for this important\npublic work, he must qualify himself in private by seeking heavenly\nknowledge. He must meditate and pray, and by studying become\nacquainted with the prophecies and the will of God. Away from\nthe busy world, whose cares and alluring pleasures would divert his\nmind and pervert his thoughts and imaginings, he was shut up with\nGod and nature.... By his strictly temperate habits he secured to\nhimself physical, mental, and moral health....\nJohn accustomed himself to privations and hardships, that he\nmight be able to stand among the people as unmoved by circum-\nstances as the rocks and mountains of the wilderness that had sur-\nrounded him for thirty years.

Zealous in securing\nworldly treasure and honor, the people had forgotten God....\nThe teaching of John aroused in the hearts of many a great desire\nto have a part in the blessings that Christ was to bring, and they\nreceived the truth. These saw the need of reform. They must not\nonly seek to enter in at the strait gate; they must strive and agonize in\norder to have the blessings of the gospel. Nothing save a vehement\ndesire, a determined will, a fixedness of purpose, could resist the\nmoral darkness that covered the earth as the pall of death. In order\nto obtain the blessings that it was their privilege to have, they must\nwork earnestly, they must deny self.\nThe work of John the Baptist represents the work for these times.\nHis work, and the work of those who go forth in the spirit and power\nofElijahtoarousethepeoplefromtheirapathy, arethesameinmany\nrespects.

Which will prevail? Satan, knowing that his time\nis short, has come down with great power and is working with all\ndeceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish. Every agent\nthat he can employ, he is using to prevent souls from coming to\nthe light.

Just such a work as that of\nJohn is to be carried on in these last days.

They sought not the counsel of God who had created\nthem, nor cared to do His will. The rebuke of God was upon them\nbecause they followed the imagination of their own hearts; and there\nwas violence in the land. “And it repented the Lord that he had made\nman on the earth....”\nIn His teachings Christ referred to this. “But as the days of Noe\nwere,” He said, “so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.”...\nThe inhabitants of the antediluvian world had the warning given\nthem prior to their overthrow, but the warning was not heeded. They\nrefused to listen to the words of Noah; they mocked at his message.\nRighteous people lived in that generation. Before the destruction\nof the antediluvian world, Enoch bore his testimony unflinchingly.\nAnd in prophetic vision he saw the condition of the world at the\npresent time.

The class who professed a knowledge of God were the\nones who had the greatest influence and took the lead in making\nof none effect His word spoken to them by Noah. They not only\nrejected the message of the faithful preacher of righteousness them-\nselves, but like their master the devil they sought every means in\ntheir power to prevent others from believing and being obedient\nto God.... While Noah was sounding the note of warning of the\ncoming destruction of that generation, was their day of opportunity\nand privilege to become wise unto salvation. But they gave their\nminds to the control of Satan rather than God, and he deceived them\nas he did our first parents....\nThe world before the Flood reasoned that for centuries the laws\nof nature had been fixed. The recurring seasons had come in their\norder. The rivers and brooks had never yet passed their boundaries\nbut had borne their waters safely to the proud sea. Fixed decrees had\nkept the waters from overflowing their banks. But these reasons did\nnot recognize the Hand that had stayed the waters, saying, thus far\nshalt thou go and no farther.... They reasoned then as people reason\nnow, as though nature was above the God of nature, and her ways\nwere so fixed that God Himself could not change them, thus making\nin the minds of the world God’s messages of warning a delusion, a\ngrand deception, reasoning that if the message of Noah was correct,\nnature would be turned out of her course of order....\nHuman nature in Noah’s day, uninfluenced by the Spirit of God,\nis the same in our age.

Exodus\n20:10.\nWhenGodcreatedtheearthandplacedhumanbeingsuponit, He\ndivided time into seven periods. Six He gave to us for our own use,\nto employ in secular business; one He reserved for Himself. Having\nrested on the seventh day, He blessed and sanctified it. Henceforth,\nthe seventh day was to be regarded as the Lord’s rest day and to be\nsacredly observed as the memorial of His creative work. It was not\nthe first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth day that was sanctified,\nor set apart to a holy use; neither was it a seventh part of time and\nno day in particular; but it was the seventh day, the day upon which\nGod had rested....\nWhen the law was given at Sinai, the Sabbath was placed in\nthe midst of moral precepts, in the very bosom of the Decalogue.\nBut the Sabbath institution was not then made known for the first\ntime. The fourth commandment places its origin at Creation. The\nCreator’s rest day was hallowed by Adam in holy Eden and by the\npeople of God throughout the patriarchal ages. During Israel’s long\nbondage in Egypt, under taskmasters that knew not God, they could\nnot keep the Sabbath; therefore the Lord brought them out where\nthey could remember His holy day....\nA threefold miracle was wrought in honor of the Sabbath, even\nbefore the law was given on Sinai. A double quantity of manna fell\non the sixth day, none upon the Sabbath, and the portion needed for\nthe Sabbath was preserved sweet and pure, when if any were kept\nover at any other time, it became unfit for food. Here is conclusive\nevidence that the Sabbath was instituted at Creation, when the foun-\ndations of the earth were laid, when the morning stars sang together,\nand all the sons of God shouted for joy. And its sacredness remains\nunchanged, and will so remain even to the close of time. From the\nCreation, every precept of the divine law has been obligatory on\nGod’sSabbath,December9 737\nmankind and has been observed by those who fear the Lord.

It is by bringing our ap-\npetites and passions into subjection to the will of God and showing\nin our lives the fruits of holiness. We must deal justly, love mercy,\nand walk humbly before God.

They asked, “Wilt thou at this time restore\nagain the kingdom to Israel?” The Lord rebuked their curiosity and\nsaid, “It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the\nFather hath put in his own power.”—General Conference Bulletin,\nfourth quarter 1896, p. 764.\nIt is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has\nput in his own authority.

The\neternal principles of truth should be extolled. The holy and pater-\nnal character of God should be presented to all. Our obligation in\nour daily actions should be laid bare, that we may understand our\nrelation to God and to each other; for we are to watch for souls as\nthey who must give an account.

Revelation 22:14.\nIf we would enter heaven we should strive to bring all that we\ncan of heaven into our lives on earth. The religion of Christ never\ndegrades the receiver. It exerts a heavenly influence upon the minds\nandmannersofmenandwomen. WhentheWordofGodfindsaccess\nto the hearts of the rough and coarse, it commences a process of\nrefining upon the character, and those who endure it become humble\nand teachable, like little children.... They are to be living stones in\nthe temple of God, and are hewed, and squared, and chiseled, to\nfit them for God’s building. Those who are naturally full of self-\nesteem become meek and lowly of heart. They have a change of\ncharacter, and are transformed by the renewing of their minds and\nthe regeneration of the Holy Spirit.\nGod said in the beginning, “Let us make man in our image,\nafter our likeness,” but sin has almost obliterated the moral image of\nGod in humanity. This lamentable condition would have known no\nchange or hope if Jesus had not come down to our world to be our\nSavior and Example. In the midst of a world’s moral degradation\nHe stands, a beautiful and spotless character, the one model for\nour imitation. We must study, and copy, and follow the Lord Jesus\nChrist; then we shall bring the loveliness of His character into our\nown life and weave His beauty into our daily words and actions....\nThrough Christ we may possess the spirit of love and obedience to\nthe commands of God. Through His merits it may be restored in\nour fallen natures; and when the judgment shall sit and the books be\nopened, we may be the recipients of God’s approval.\nJohn saw the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, with its twelve gates\nof pearl and twelve foundations of precious stones, coming down\nfrom God out of heaven....

[the] king of Babylon sent letters and a present to\nHezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.\nAnd Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of\nhis precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the\nprecious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was\nfound in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all\nhis dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not. Then came Isaiah\nthe prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these\nmen? and from whence came they unto thee?... What have they seen\nin thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in mine house\nhave they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not\nshewed them....”\nThe visit of the ambassadors to Hezekiah was a test of his grati-\ntude and devotion.... God had raised him from a bed of death, giving\nhim a new lease of life. The Babylonians had heard of his wonderful\nrecovery. They marveled that the sun had been turned back ten\ndegrees, as a sign that the word of the Lord should be fulfilled. They\nsent messengers to Hezekiah to congratulate him on his recovery.\nThe visit of these messengers gave him an opportunity to extol the\nGod of heaven. How easy it would have been to point them to the\nGod of gods. But pride and vanity took possession of Hezekiah’s\nheart, and in his self-exaltation he laid open to their covetous eyes\nthe treasures with which God had enriched His people.... His in-\ndiscretion prepared the way for national disaster. The ambassadors\ncarried to Babylon the report of Hezekiah’s riches, and the king\nand his counselors planned to enrich Babylon with the treasures of\nJerusalem.\nHonortheGiverofGifts,December18 755\nHad Hezekiah improved the opportunity given him to bear wit-\nness to the power, the goodness, the compassion, of the God of\nIsrael, the report of the ambassadors would have been as light pierc-\ning darkness. But he magnified himself above the Lord of hosts and\nfailed to give God the glory....\nOh, that those for whom God has done marvelous things would\nshow forth His praises and tell of His mighty works. But how often\nthose for whom God works are like Hezekiah-forgetful of the Giver\nLet a man examine himself. 1 Corinthians 11:28.\nThis world is a training school, and the great object of life should\nbe to obtain a fitness for those glorious mansions that Jesus has\ngone to prepare. Let us remember that this work of preparation is\nan individual work. We are not saved in groups. The purity and\ndevotion of one will not offset the want of these qualities in another.\nEach case must bear individual inspection. Each of us must be tested\nand found without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.\nWe are living in the great antitypical day of atonement. Jesus is\nnow in the heavenly sanctuary, making reconciliation for the sins of\nHis people, and the judgment of the righteous dead has been going\non almost forty years [written in May 1884]. How soon the cases of\nthe living will come in review before this tribunal we know not; but\nwe do know thatwe are living in the closing scenes of earth’s history,\nstanding, as it were, on the very borders of the eternal world. It is\nimportant that each of us inquire, How stands my case in the courts\nof heaven? Will my sins be blotted out? Am I defective in character,\nand so blinded to these defects by the customs and opinions of the\nworld that sin does not appear to me to be as exceedingly offensive\nto God as it really is? It is no time now to allow our minds to be\nabsorbed with the things of earth while we give only occasional\nthoughts to God and make but slight preparation for the country to\nwhich we are journeying.\nIn the typical Day of Atonement, all the people were required\nto afflict their souls before God. They were not to afflict the souls\nof others, but the work was between God and their own souls. The\nsame work of self-examination and humiliation is required of each\nof us now.... Precious, golden moments which should be spent in\nseeking the inward adorning of a meek and quiet spirit are frittered\naway in adorning the dress and in other trifling matters not at all\nessential to comfort....\nIndividuallyResponsible,December19 757\nWe are living in an important and eventful age. We are almost\nhome. Soon the many mansions that our Savior has gone to prepare\nwill burst upon our sight.... We may now have in our hearts joy and\npeace that are unspeakable and full of glory; and soon, at the coming\nof Christ, the prize that lies at the end of the Christian race will be\nours to enjoy throughout ceaseless ages.—Signs of the Times, May\n29, 1884.\nAsk the Lord for rain in the time of the latter rain.

Under the influence of the\nfertilizing showers, the tender shoot springs up. The latter rain,\nfalling near the close of the season, ripens the grain, and prepares\nit for the sickle. The Lord employs these operations of nature to\nrepresent the work of the Holy Spirit. As the dew and the rain\nare given first to cause the seed to germinate and then to ripen the\nharvest, so the Holy Spirit is given to carry forward, from one stage\nto another, the process of spiritual growth. The ripening of the grain\nrepresents the completion of the work of God’s grace in the soul....\nThe latter rain, ripening earth’s harvest, represents the spiritual\ngrace that prepares the church for the coming of the Son of man.\nBut unless the former rain has fallen, there will be no life; the green\nblade will not spring up. Unless the early showers have done their\nwork, the latter rain can bring no seed to perfection....\nThe work that God has begun in the human heart in giving His\nlight and knowledge must be continually going forward. All of\nus must realize our own necessity. The heart must be emptied of\nevery defilement and cleansed for the indwelling of the Spirit. It\nwas by the confession and forsaking of sin, by earnest prayer and\nconsecration of themselves to God, that the early disciples prepared\nfor the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost.

Luke 14:23.\nA man who had been invited to the feast with Christ in the house\nof one of the chief Pharisees, and who heard Christ declare what\nwas the duty of those who had God’s bounties, had exclaimed in\nself-satisfied complacency, “Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the\nkingdom of God.” He had designed to draw away the minds of those\nat the feast from the subject of their practical duty; but instead of\nthis he furnished an occasion for the utterance of a parable that had\nstill deeper significance, and that more plainly opened before the\ncompany the character and value of their present privileges....\nChrist had sent out an invitation to a feast that He had provided\nat great cost. He had sent the Holy Spirit to move upon the minds\nof prophets and holy men of old to invite His chosen people to the\nrich feast of the gospel.... The man who had sought to divert the\nattention of the company spoke with great assurance, as though he\nthought he would certainly eat bread in the kingdom of God. But\nJesus warned him and all present against the danger of rejecting the\npresent invitation to the gospel feast....\nThe Lord had first sent His invitation to His chosen people,\nbut they had slighted and rejected His messenger. How vain, how\nneedless, were the excuses they offered; but are the excuses that men\nand women give in this age any more sensible than those offered in\nthe time of Christ?\nSome who are invited exclaim, “I beg Thee have me excused. If\nI should come, my neighbors would jest at and ridicule me, and I\ncannot bear their scorn. I have lived among them a long time, and\nI do not want to displease my neighbors.”... Others are desirous of\npaying for their lands and of building up their temporal interests, and\nthe powers of mind and soul and body are absorbed in their earthly\naffairs....\nAccepttheInvitation,December21 761\nThe precious message has come to us in these last days.... The\ninvitation has been given, “Come; for all things are now ready.”...\nChrist has pledged His own life forthe redemption of His people,\nand He would have them consider their higher, eternal claims.—The\nYou shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea\nand Samaria, and to the end of the earth. Acts 1:8.\nChrist commissioned His disciples to do the work He had left in\ntheir hands, beginning at Jerusalem. Jerusalem had been the scene\nof His amazing condescension for the human race. There He had\nsuffered, been rejected and condemned. The land of Judea was His\nbirthplace. There, clad in the garb of humanity, He had walked with\nhumanity, and few had discerned how near heaven came to earth\nwhen Jesus was among them. At Jerusalem the work of the disciples\nmust begin.\nBut the work was not to stop here. It was to be extended to the\nearth’s remotest bounds. To His disciples Christ said: You have\nbeen witnesses of My life of self-sacrifice in behalf of the world.\nYou have witnessed My labors for Israel. Although they would not\ncome unto Me that they might have life, although priests and rulers\nhave done unto Me as they wished, although they have rejected Me\nas the Scripture foretold, they shall have still another opportunity\nof accepting the Son of God. You have seen that all who come to\nMe confessing their sins, I freely receive. He that cometh to Me I\nwill in no wise cast out. All who will, may be reconciled to God\nand receive everlasting life. To you, My disciples, I commit this\nmessage of mercy. It is to be given to Israel first, and then to all\nnations, tongues, and peoples....\nThrough the gift of the Holy Spirit the disciples were to receive\na marvelous power. Their testimony was to be confirmed by signs\nand wonders....\nThe disciples were to begin their work where they were. The\nhardest and most unpromising field was not to be passed by. So all\nof Christ’s workers are to begin where they are. In our own families\nmay be souls hungry for sympathy, starving for the bread of life.\nThere may be children to be trained for Christ. There are heathen at\nToAllNations,December22 763\nour very doors. Let us do faithfully the work that is nearest. Then\nlet our efforts be extended as far as God’s hand may lead the way.\nThe work of many may appear to be restricted by circumstances;\nbut wherever it is, if performed with faith and diligence it will be\nfelt to the uttermost parts of the earth. Christ’s work when upon\nearth appeared to be confined to a narrow field, but multitudes from\n1913.\nAnd He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet,\nand they will gather together His elect from the four winds,\nfrom one end of heaven to the other. Matthew 24:31.\nThe leaders of the Jewish nation had the Old Testament Scrip-\ntures, which plainly foretold the manner of Christ’s first advent.\nThrough the prophet Isaiah God had described the appearance and\nmission of Christ, saying, “He is despised and rejected of men; a\nman of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.”...\nAll the wonderful events clustering around His second coming,\nthey looked for at His first. Therefore, when He came, they were not\nprepared to receive Him....\nBetween the first and the second advent of Christ a wonderful\ncontrast will be seen. No human language can portray the scenes of\nthe second coming of the Son of man in the clouds of heaven. He is\nto come with His own glory and with the glory of the Father and of\nthe holy angels. He will come clad in the robe of light, which He\nhas worn from the days of eternity. Angels will accompany Him....\nThe sound of the trumpet will be heard, calling the sleeping dead\nfrom the grave....\nAs they [the Jewish leaders] gaze upon His glory, there flashes\nbefore their minds the memory of the Son of man clad in the garb of\nhumanity. They remember how they treated Him, how they refused\nHim and pressed close to the side of the great apostate. The scenes\nof Christ’s life appear before them in all their clearness. All He did,\nall He said, the humiliation to which He descended to save them\nfrom the taint of sin, rises before them in condemnation....\nWe are now amid the perils of the last days. The scenes of\nconflict are hastening on, and the day of days is just upon us. Are\nwe prepared for the issue?...\nThe Son of man will bestow upon the righteous the crown of\neverlastinglife, andtheyshall“servehimdayandnightinhistemple:\nFirstandSecondAdvent,December23 765\nand he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall\nhunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light\non them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the\nthrone shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of\nwaters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.”—The\nI will come again and receive you to Myself John 14:3.\nThe time of Jesus’ betrayal, suffering, and crucifixion was draw-\ning near; and as the disciples gathered around Him, the Lord un-\nfolded to them the mournful events that were about to take place,\nand their hearts were filled with sorrow. To comfort them He spoke\nthese tender words: “Let not your heart be troubled.... I will come\nagain, and receive you unto myself.” He directed their minds away\nfrom the scenes of sorrow to the mansions of heaven and the time of\nreunion in the kingdom of God.... Though He must go from them\nand ascend to His Father, His work for those He loved would not\nbe at an end. He was to prepare homes for those who, for His sake,\nwere to be pilgrims and strangers on the earth....\nAfter His resurrection “he led them out as far as to Bethany,\nand he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. And it came to pass,\nwhile he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up\ninto heaven.”... Do you imagine as they went back to Jerusalem that\nthey said to one another, “Well, the Lord has left us. What is now\nthe use of trying to gain followers to Jesus? Let us return to our\nnets.”... There is no record of any such conversation. Not a line is\nwritten or a hint given that they had a thought of leaving the service\nof their ascended Lord for the service of self and the world. The\nSavior’s hand had been outstretched in blessing His disciples He had\nleft behind as He ascended. They had seen His glory. He had gone\nto prepare mansions for them. Their salvation had been provided\nfor, and if they were faithful in complying with the conditions, they\nwould assuredly follow Him to the world of unending joy. Their\nhearts were filled with songs of rejoicing and praise.\nWe all have the same cause for thanksgiving. The resurrection\nand ascension of our Lord is a sure evidence of the triumph of the\nsaints of God over death and the grave, and a pledge that heaven\nis open to those who wash their robes of character and make them\nWhataChristmasPresent! December24 767\nwhite in the blood of the Lamb. Jesus ascended to the Father as\na representative of the human race, and God will bring those who\nreflect His image to behold and share with Him His glory....\nLet us go forward together to reach the great reward and join\nin the song of the redeemed. If we ever sing the praises of God in\nheaven, we must first sing them here.—Signs of the Times, January\n27, 1888.\nEnter into the joy of your lord.

Jesusledamultitude\nof captives who had risen from the grave at His resurrection. As\nthe glorious company approach the gates of the eternal city, the\nangels sing, “Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up,\nye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.” And the\nangels guarding the gates respond, “Who is this King of glory?”\nThe attendant angels reply, “The Lord of hosts, he is the King of\nglory.” As the glorious train passes in, the angels are about to bow in\nadoration before the Lord of glory; but He waves them back. Before\nHe will permit their homage He must know that His sacrifice for the\nfallen race has been accepted of the Father. He must know whether\nthe price paid for the redemption of the lost has been sufficient\nto ransom them from the power of sin and the grave.... Amid the\nsplendorofthe courts ofglory, amidten thousandtimes ten thousand\nand thousands of thousands waiting to cast their crowns at His feet,\nHe does not forget those that He has left on earth to bear opposition,\nreproach, and scorn. After the Father has assured Him that the\nransom paid is accepted, still He has a request to offer for those who\nbelieve in Him and follow in His footsteps, “Father, I will that they\nalso, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they\nmay behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me\nbefore the foundation of the world.” He requested that His disciples\nmight enter into His joy and share His glory, and at last the faithful\nservant of the Lord will hear the glad words, “Enter thou into the joy\nof thy lord.”\nWhen He had finished preferring His requests, the Father gave\nthe command, “Let all the angels of God worship him.” Then the\nsong of joy and love swells through the heavenly courts, “Worthy,\nPromiseFulfilled,December25 769\nworthy, worthy, is the Lamb that was slain, and lives again, a tri-\numphant conqueror.” And this same Jesus, whom unnumbered hosts\nof angels delight to adore, is coming again to fulfill His promise\nand receive those who love Him unto Himself.

The Lord does not reprove the servant who has doubled his\ntalent, who has done according to his ability. Those who thus prove\ntheir fidelity can be commended and rewarded; but those who loiter\nin the vineyard, those who do nothing, or do negligently the Lord’s\nwork, make manifest their real attitude toward the work to which\nthey have been called, by their works. They show that their hearts\nare not in the service for which they have been engaged....\nLet none mourn that they have not larger talents to use for the\nMaster.... Thank God for the ability you have, and pray that you may\nbe enabled to meet the responsibilities that have been placed upon\nyou. If you desire greater usefulness, go to work and acquire what\nyou mourn for. Go to work with steady patience, and do your very\nUseWhatYouHave,December28 775\nbest, irrespective of what others are doing.... Let not your thought\nor your words be, Oh, that I had a larger work! Oh, that I were\nin this or that position! Do your duty where you are.

Some have made an objection\nto my work, because I teach that it is our duty to be looking for\nChrist’s personal appearing in the clouds of heaven. They have said,\n“You would think that the day of the Lord was right upon us to hear\nMrs. White speak in reference to the coming of Christ; and she\nhas been preaching on that same subject for the last forty years,\nand the Lord has not yet come.” This very objection might have\nbeen brought against the words of Christ Himself. He said by the\nmouth of the beloved disciple, “Behold, I come quickly,” and John\nresponds, “Even so, come, Lord Jesus.”\nJesus spoke these words as words ofwarning andencouragement\nto His people; and why should we not heed them? The Lord has\nsaid that it is the faithful who will be found watching and waiting\nfor Him. It was the unfaithful servant who said, “My lord delayeth\nhis coming,” and began to smite his fellow servants and to eat and\ndrink with the drunken.\nThe exact time of Christ’s second coming is not revealed. Jesus\nsaid, “No man knoweth the day nor the hour.” But He also gave\nsigns of His coming, and said, “When ye shall see all these things,\nknow that it is near, even at the doors.” He bade them, as the signs\nof His coming should appear, “Look up, and lift up your heads;\nfor your redemption draweth nigh.” And in view of these things\nthe apostle wrote, “Ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day\nshouldovertakeyouasathief. Yeareallthechildrenoflight, andthe\nchildren of the day.” Since we know not the hour of Christ’s coming,\nwe must live soberly and godly in this present world, “looking for\nBlessedHope,December29 777\nthat blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and\nour Saviour Jesus Christ.”\nChrist gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all\niniquity and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good\nworks. His people are to preserve their peculiar character as His\nrepresentatives. There is work for every one of them to do.... Says\nthe apostle, “We are not of the night, nor of darkness.

Satan has come down\nin great power, knowing that his time is short; and he is working\n“with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish.” The\nwarning comes to us through God’s Word that, if it were possible,\nhe would deceive the very elect.\nWonderful events are soon to open before the world. The end of\nall things is at hand. The time of trouble is about to come upon the\npeople of God. Then it is that the decree will go forth forbidding\nthosewhokeeptheSabbathoftheLordtobuyorsell,andthreatening\nthem with punishment, and even death, if they do not observe the\nfirst day of the week as the Sabbath....\nInthetimeoftrouble, Satanstirsupthewicked, andtheyencircle\nthe people of God to destroy them. But he does not know that\n“pardon” has been written opposite their names in the books of\nheaven. He does not know that the command has been given, “Take\naway the filthy garments” from them, clothe them with “change of\nraiment,” and set “a fair mitre” upon their heads....\nWhile we speak of the necessity of separating from sin, remem-\nber that Christ came to our world to save sinners, and that “he is able\nalso to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him.” It\nis our privilege to believe that His blood is able to cleanse us from\nevery spot and stain of sin. We must not limit the power of the Holy\nOne of Israel. He wants us to come to Him just as we are, sinful\nand polluted. His blood is efficacious. I entreat you not to grieve\nHis Spirit by continuing in sin. If you fall under temptation, do\nnot become discouraged. This promise comes ringing down along\nthe line to our time, “If any man sin, we have an advocate with the\nFather, Jesus Christ the righteous.” I feel that for this one promise\nPreparingforHeaven,December30 779\na continual song of thanksgiving ought to go forth from the lips of\nmortals. Letus gatherupthese precious jewels ofpromise, andwhen\nSatan accuses us of our great sinfulness, and tempts us to doubt the\npower of God to save, let us repeat the words of Christ, “Him that\ncometh to me I will in no wise cast out.”—The Review and Herald,\nFor whatever things were written before were written for our\nlearning, that we through the patience and comfort of the\nScriptures might have hope. Romans 15:4.\nWe have but one probation in which to form character, and our\ndestiny depends upon the manner of character we form. Those who\non earth have formed characters that through the grace of Christ bear\nthe heavenly mold will be ripened through the gracious influence\nof the Holy Spirit for the eternal reward. They become partakers\nof the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the\nworld through lust. It is a realization of the fact that our characters\nare Christlike that calls forth the song of praise and thanksgiving to\nGod and to the Lamb. Those who appreciate the goodness, mercy,\nand love of Christ, and by beholding Him become changed into\nHis image, will be partakers of eternal life. The attributes of their\ncharacter are like those of Christ, and they cannot fail of the rest that\nremains for the people of God....\nIf we would see heaven, we must have heaven below. We must\nhave a heaven to go to heaven in. We must have heaven in our\nfamilies, through Christ continually approaching unto God. Christ\nis the great center of attraction, and the child of God hid in Christ\nmeets with God, and is lost in the divine being. Prayer is the life of\nthe soul; it is feeding on Christ; it is turning our faces fully toward\nthe Sun of Righteousness. As we turn our faces toward Him, He\nturns His face toward us....\nBy simple, earnest, contrite prayer, heavenly mindedness is\ngreatly increased. No other means of grace can be substituted and\nhealthiness of the soul be preserved. Prayer brings the soul into\nimmediate contact with the wellspring of life and strengthens the\nspiritual sinew and muscle of our religious experience; for we live\nby faith, seeing Him who is invisible....\nHeavenBelowandHeavenAbove,December31 781\nTheWordofGodisaspiritualgranaryfromwhencethesoulmay\nreceive that which will nourish its life.
