Hebrews 5:7, NKJV.\nEvening is drawing on as Jesus calls to His side three of His\ndisciples, Peter, James, and John, and leads them across the fields,\nand far up a rugged path, to a lonely mountainside....\nThe light of the setting sun still lingers on the mountaintop, and\ngilds with its fading glory the path they are traveling. But soon the\nlight dies out from hill as well as valley, the sun disappears behind\nthe western horizon, and the solitary travelers are wrapped in the\ndarkness of night....\nPresently Christ tells them that they are now to go no farther.\nStepping a little aside from them, the Man of Sorrows pours out His\nsupplications with strong crying and tears. He prays for strength to\nendure the test in behalf of humanity. He must Himself gain a fresh\nhold on Omnipotence, for only thus can He contemplate the future.\nAnd He pours out His heart longings for His disciples, that in the\nhour of the power of darkness their faith may not fail....\nAt first the disciples unite their prayers with His in sincere devo-\ntion; but after a time they are overcome with weariness, and, even\nwhile trying to retain their interest in the scene, they fall asleep.\nJesus has told them of His sufferings; He has taken them with Him\nthat they might unite with Him in prayer; even now He is praying\nfor them. The Savior has seen the gloom of His disciples, and has\nlonged to lighten their grief by an assurance that their faith has not\nbeen in vain.... Now the burden of His prayer is that they may be\ngiven a manifestation of the glory He had with the Father before the\nworld was, that His kingdom may be revealed to human eyes, and\nthat His disciples may be strengthened to behold it. He pleads that\nthey may witness a manifestation of His divinity that will comfort\nJesus,OurPattern,DependedonPrayer,January1 19\nthem in the hour of His supreme agony with the knowledge that He\nis of a surety the Son of God and that His shameful death is a part of\nthe plan of redemption.\nHis prayer is heard. While He is bowed in lowliness upon the\nstony ground, suddenly the heavens open, the golden gates of the\nCity of God are thrown wide, and holy radiance descends upon\nthe mount, enshrouding the Savior’s form. Divinity from within\nflashes through humanity, and meets the glory coming from above.\nArising from His prostrate position, Christ stands in godlike majesty.\nThe soul agony is gone. His countenance now shines “as the sun,”\nand His garments are “white as the light.”—The Desire of Ages,\n419-421.\n[9] Christ’s Example Gives Power to Resist Temptation,"

(See 2 Chronicles 7:1.) And by night the Lord had appeared\nto Solomon to tell him that his prayerhad been heard, and that mercy\nwould be shown those who should worship there....\nFor many years the Passover had not been observed as a national\nfestival. The division of the kingdom after the close of Solomon’s\nreign had made this seem impracticable. But the terrible judgments\nbefalling the ten tribes were awakening in the hearts of some a\ndesire for better things; and the stirring messages of the prophets\nwere having their effect.... The impenitent turned lightly aside;\nnevertheless some, eager to seek God for a clearer knowledge of His\nwill, “humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem” (2 Chronicles\n30:10, 11).—Prophets and Kings, 335-337.\nFor stricken Israel there was but one remedy—a turning away\nfrom the sins that had brought upon them the chastening hand of the\nAlmighty, and a turning to the Lord with full purpose of heart. To\nthem had been given the assurance, “If I shut up heaven that there\nbe no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I\nPrayerCloselyRelatedtoReformation,January19 55\nsend pestilence among my people; if my people, which are called\nby my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face,\nand turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and\nwill forgive their sin, and will heal their land” (2 Chronicles 7:13,\n14). It was to bring to pass this blessed result that God continued to\nwithhold from them the dew and the rain until a decided reformation\nshould take place.—Prophets and Kings, 128."

Everydayyou are to pray, “Give us this dayourdaily\nbread.” Be not dismayed if you have not sufficient for tomorrow.\nYou have the assurance of His promise, “So shalt thou dwell in the\nland, and verily thou shalt be fed.” David says, “I have been young,\nand now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his\nseed begging bread” (Psalm 37:3, 25)....\nHe who lightened the cares and anxieties of His widowed mother\nand helped her to provide for the household at Nazareth sympathizes\nwith every mother in her struggle to provide her children food. He\nwho had compassion on the multitude because they “fainted, and\nwere scattered abroad” (Matthew 9:36) still has compassion on the\nsuffering poor. His hand is stretched out toward them in blessing;\nand in the very prayer which He gave His disciples, He teaches us\nto remember the poor....\nThe prayer for daily bread includes not only food to sustain the\nbody, but that spiritual bread which will nourish the soul unto life\neverlasting. Jesus bids us, “Labour not for the meat which perisheth,\nbut for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life” (John 6:27).\nHe says, “I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if\nany man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever” (Verse 51). Our\nSavior is the Bread of Life, and it is by beholding His love, by\nreceiving it into the soul, that we feed upon the bread which came\ndown from heaven.\nWe receive Christ through His Word, and the Holy Spirit is given\nto open the Word of God to our understanding and bring home its\ntruths to our hearts. We are to pray day by day that as we read His\nWord, God will send His Spirit to reveal to us the truth that will\nstrengthen our souls for the day’s need."

Ephesians 1:18,\nNKJV.\nIn a knowledge of God all true knowledge and real development\nhave their source. Wherever we turn, in the physical, the mental, or\nthe spiritual realm; in whatever we behold, apart from the blight of\nsin, this knowledge is revealed. Whatever line of investigation we\npursue, with a sincere purpose to arrive at truth, we are brought in\ntouch with the unseen, mighty Intelligence that is working in and\nthrough all. The mind of humanity is brought into communion with\nthe mind of God, the finite with the Infinite. The effect of such\ncommunion on body and mind and soul is beyond estimate.\nIn this communion is found the highest education. It is God’s\nown method of development. “Acquaint now thyself with him” (Job\n22:21) is His message to humankind. The method outlined in these\nwords was the method followed in the education of the father of our\nrace. When in the glory of sinless manhood Adam stood in holy\nEden, it was thus that God instructed him....\nWhen Adam came from the Creator’s hand, he bore, in his\nphysical, mental, and spiritual nature, a likeness to his Maker. “God\ncreated man in his own image” (Genesis 1:27), and it was His\npurpose that the longer human beings lived the more fully they\nshould reveal this image—the more fully reflect the glory of the\nCreator. Allthefacultieswerecapableofdevelopment; theircapacity\nand vigor were continually to increase. Vast was the scope offered\nfor their exercise, glorious the field opened to their research.... Face-\nto-face, heart-to-heart communion with his Maker was his high\nprivilege. Had he remained loyal to God, all this would have been\nhis forever....\nInSincerePursuitofTruthWeCommuneWithGod,January18 53\nBut by disobedience this was forfeited. Through sin the divine\nlikeness was marred, and well-nigh obliterated. Man’s physical\npowers were weakened, his mental capacity was lessened, his spiri-\ntual vision dimmed. He had become subject to death. Yet the race\nwas not left without hope. By infinite love and mercy the plan of\nsalvation had been devised, and a life of probation was granted. To\nrestore in the human family the image of their Maker, to bring them\nback to the perfection in which they were created, to promote the\ndevelopment of body, mind, and soul, that the divine purpose in their\ncreation might be realized—this was to be the work of redemption.\nThis is the object of education, the great object of life.—Education,\n14-16."

This is the\nvery work He wants every person to do, to obey God intelligently,\nand by precept and example teach others what they must do in order\nto be obedient children of God.\nJesus has helped the whole world to an intelligent knowledge of\nHis divine mission and work. He came to represent the character\nof the Father to our world; and as we study the life, the words, and\nworks of Christ, we are helped in every way in the education of\nobedience to God; and as we copy the example He has given us,\nwe are living epistles known and read of all men. We are the living\nhuman agencies to represent to the world the character of Christ.\nNot only did Christ show us how we may become obedient children,\nbut He showed us in His own life and character just how to do those\nthings which are right and acceptable with God, so there is no reason\nwhy we should not do those things which are pleasing in His sight.\nWe are ever to be thankful that Jesus has proved to us by actual\nlife that we can keep the commandments of God, contradicting\nSatan’s falsehood that we cannot keep them. The great Teacher\ncame to our world to stand at the head of humanity, to thus elevate\nand sanctify humanity by His holy obedience to all the requirements\nof God, showing it is possible to obey all the commandments of God.\nHe has demonstrated that a lifelong obedience is possible. Thus He\ngives people to the world, as the Father gave the Son, to exemplify\nin their life the life of Christ.\nChrist redeemed Adam’s disgraceful failure and fall, and was\nconqueror, thus testifying to all the unfallen worlds and to fallen"

In the sentence pronounced upon Satan was given an\nintimation of redemption. “I will put enmity between thee and the\nwoman,” God said, “and between thy seed and her seed; it shall\nbruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel” (Genesis 3:15). This\nsentence, spoken in the hearing of our first parents, was to them a\npromise.

All that had been lost by yielding to Satan could be regained\nthrough Christ.\nThis intimation also nature repeats to us. Though marred by sin,\nit speaks not only of creation but of redemption.

[Exodus 24:4-8 quoted.]\nHere the people received the conditions of the covenant. They\nmade a solemn covenant with God, typifying the covenant made\nbetween Godandeverybelieverin JesusChrist. Theconditionswere\nplainly laid before the people. They were not left to misunderstand\nthem. When they were requested to decide whether they would\nagree to all the conditions given, they unanimously consented to\nobey every obligation. They had already consented to obey God’s\ncommandments. The principles of the law were now particularized,\nthat they might know how much was involved in covenanting to\nobey the law; and they accepted the specifically defined particulars\nof the law.\nIf the Israelites had obeyed God’s requirements, they would\nhave been practical Christians. They would have been happy; for\nthey would have been keeping God’s ways, and not following the\ninclinations of their own natural hearts. Moses did not leave them to\nmisconstrue the words of the Lord or to misapply His requirements.\nHe wrote all the words of the Lord in a book, that they might be\nreferred to afterward. In the mount he had written them as Christ\nHimself dictated them.\nBravely did the Israelites speak the words promising obedience\nto the Lord, after hearing His covenant read in the audience of the\npeople. They said, “All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be\nobedient” (Exodus 24:7). Then the people were set apart and sealed\nto God. A sacrifice was offered to the Lord. A portion of the blood\nof the sacrifice was sprinkled upon the altar. This signified that the\nIsraelPledgestoObeyGod’sCommandments,February7 95\npeople had consecrated themselves—body, mind, and soul—to God.\nA portion was sprinkled upon the people. This signified that through\nthe sprinkled blood of Christ, God graciously accepted them as His\nspecial treasure.

On the one hand is presented the disobedience of Adam, with\nits consequences; on the other, the obedience of Christ. The Garden\nof Eden was disgraced by Adam’s disobedience; but as by that one\ntransgression many were made sinners, so by the obedience of One,\nmany are made righteous.\nThe world has been honored with the presence of one Man\nwho was wholly and entirely obedient—One who not only believed\nand taught the claims of God’s law, but who lived the law. His\nwhole life was a representation of its holy principles. His obedience\nwas manifested in the awful agony He endured in the Garden of\nGethsemane; and through His suffering He has brought pardon to\nthe disobedient.\nWhen Christ gave to His disciples the conditions of salvation,\nHe said, “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself,\nand take up his cross, and follow me.” Self-denial and crosses lie\ndirectly in the path of every soul who will follow Jesus. Our advance\nheavenward will be opposed at every step; for Satan will come\nin many ways to mislead, to deceive, and to clothe sin with the\nappearance of good....\nI would urge you ... carefully to consider the self-denial and\nself-sacrifice that Christ has endured in your behalf, that you, if you\nchoose, may have that happiness and peace in this life which He\nalone can give, and an eternity of bliss by and by. Then will you\nnot become missionaries for Christ? Are you not willing to deny\nself for His sake? to consider how you can do Him service who has\ndone such service for you in redeeming your soul from the power"

It is not the great gifts alone that God requires and accepts,\nbut He calls for the smaller talents, and will accept them if men and\nwomen will use them to His glory.

If they cannot stop work after eight hours’ labor,\nthey become dissatisfied. But these very ones, when they enter\nbusiness for their own private benefit, will work on fully ten hours\nas they do in America and often extend their labor to twelve hours.\nThey make no complaint, because it is in their own personal interest.\nIt makes every difference whether the time is to be employed to their\nown special advantage or for the service of God or their neighbor....\nWilling service in saving the means that is so limited is more\nsatisfactory than hoarding means. With the right motive in view,\nsuch time would be reckoned as devoted to the service of God.

Some can use the pen to write a letter to some far-off\nfriend. By consecrated personal labor we may in many ways do\npersonal service for God.\nSome think that if they give a portion of their money to the cause\nof God, this is all they are required to do, and the precious time\ngiven them of God, in which they could do hours of personal service\nfor Him, passes by unimproved. It is the privilege and duty of all\nwho have health and strength to render to God active service. The\ngiving of donations in money cannot take the place of this. Those\n164 ToBeLikeJesus\nwho have no money can substitute personal labor, and even money\ncan be made in various ways in this work.\nEveryone may be a laborer together with God.

This is a precious treasure by which much good can\nbe accomplished. How are we using God’s golden opportunities?\nWe must, as Christians, set the Lord always before us, if we would\nnot lose precious hours in uselessness, and have nothing to show for\nour time.\nTime is money. If people refuse to work because they cannot\nobtain the highest wages, they are pronounced idlers. Far better\nwould it be for them to work, even if they receive much less than\nthey suppose their labors are worth.\nTime is a talent committed to our trust that may be shamefully\nmisused. Every child of God, man, woman, youth or child, should\nconsider and appreciate the value of the moments of time. If they\ndo this, they will keep themselves employed, even if they do not\nreceive as high wages as they have been able to command. They\nshould show their appreciation of diligence, and work, receiving\nwhat wages they can get. The idea of a poor person with a family\nrefusing to work for moderate wages, because it is not showing, as\nhe or she supposes, sufficient dignity for their trade, is folly that is\nnot to be encouraged.\nHow little thought has been bestowed upon this subject. How\nmuch greater prosperity might have attended the missionary enter-\nprises if this talent of time had been thoughtfully considered and\nfaithfully used. We are each one answerable to God for the time\nthat has been wantonly thrown away, and for the use of which we\nmust give an account to God. This is a stewardship that has been but\n166 ToBeLikeJesus\nlittle appreciated; many think it not sin to waste hours and days in\ndoing nothing to benefit themselves or to bless others.—Manuscript\nReleases 6:80, 81."

Many mis-\ntakes are made because people do not heed this instruction. Many\nwho are entrusted with some humble line of work to do for the Mas-\nter soon become dissatisfied, and think that they should be teachers\nand leaders.

There is not a follower of Christ but\nhas some peculiar gift for the use of which he or she is accountable\nto God.\nMany have excused themselves from rendering their gift to the\nservice of Christ, because others were possessed of superior endow-\nments and advantages.

Then\nhow shall we know that they have not the truth, unless we bring\neverything to the Scriptures? Christ has warned us to beware of\nfalse prophets who will come to us in His name, saying that they are\nChrist.\nNow, if you should take the position that it is not important\nfor you to understand the Scriptures for yourselves, you will be in\ndanger of being led away with these doctrines. Christ has said that\nthere will be a company who in the day of retributive judgment will\nsay, “Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy\nname have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful\nworks?” ButChristwillsay, “Departfrom me, ye thatworkiniquity.”\nNow, we want to understand what sin is; that it is the transgres-\nsion of God’s law. This is the only definition given in the Scriptures.\nTherefore we see that those who claim to be led of God, and go right\naway from Him and His law, do not search the Scriptures. But the\nLord will lead His people; for He says that His sheep will follow\nif they hear His voice, but a stranger will they not follow. Then it\nbecomes us to thoroughly understand the Scriptures. And we will\nnot have to inquire whether others have the truth; for it will be seen\nin their characters.\nThe time is coming when Satan will work miracles right in your\nsight, claiming that he is Christ; and if your feet are not firmly\nestablished upon the truth of God, then you will be led away from\nyour foundation. The only safety for you is to search for the truth as\nfor hid treasures. Dig for the truth as you would for treasures in the\nHearChrist’sVoiceThroughtheWord,April17 233\nearth, and present the Word of God, the Bible, before your heavenly\nFather, and say, Enlighten me; teach me what is truth.

The Sabbath was com-\nmitted to Adam, the father and representative of the whole human\nfamily. Its observance was to be an act of grateful acknowledgment,\non the part of all who should dwell upon the earth, that God was\ntheir Creator and their rightful Sovereign; that they were the work\nof His hands and the subjects of His authority.

Exodus 16:35, NKJV.\nEvery week during their long sojourn in the wilderness the Is-\nraelites witnessed a threefold miracle, designed to impress their\nminds with the sacredness of the Sabbath: a double quantity of\nmanna fell on the sixth day, none on the seventh, and the portion\nneeded for the Sabbath was preserved sweet and pure, when if any\nwere kept over at any other time it became unfit for use.\nIn the circumstances connected with the giving of the manna,\nwe have conclusive evidence that the Sabbath was not instituted, as\nmany claim, when the law was given at Sinai. Before the Israelites\ncame to Sinai they understood the Sabbath to be obligatory upon\nthem. In being obliged to gather every Friday a double portion of\nmanna in preparation for the Sabbath, when none would fall, the\nsacred nature of the day of rest was continually impressed upon\nthem. And when some of the people went out on the Sabbath to\ngather manna, the Lord asked, “How long refuse ye to keep my\ncommandments and my laws?”\n“The children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they\ncame to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto\nthe borders of the land of Canaan.” For forty years they were daily\nreminded by this miraculous provision, of God’s unfailing care and\ntender love.

Isaiah 13:12, NKJV.\nIf it was right for David to satisfy his hunger by eating of the\nbread that had been set apart to a holy use, then it was right for the\ndisciples to supply their need by plucking the grain upon the sacred\nhours of the Sabbath. Again, the priests in the Temple performed\ngreater labor on the Sabbath than upon other days. The same labor\nin secular business would be sinful; but the work of the priests was\nin the service of God. They were performing those rites that pointed\nto the redeeming power of Christ, and their labor was in harmony\nwith the object of the Sabbath. But now Christ Himself had come.\nThe disciples, in doing the work of Christ, were engaged in God’s\nservice, and that which was necessary for the accomplishment of\nthis work it was right to do on the Sabbath day.\nChrist would teach His disciples and His enemies that the service\nof God is first of all. The object of God’s work in this world is the\nredemption of humankind; therefore that which is necessary to be\ndone on the Sabbath in the accomplishment of this work is in accord\nwith the Sabbath law. Jesus then crowned His argument by declaring\nHimselfthe “Lordofthe Sabbath,” One above allquestion andabove\nall law. This infinite Judge acquits the disciples of blame, appealing\nto the very statutes they are accused of violating....\nUpon another Sabbath, as Jesus entered a synagogue, He saw\nthere a man who had a withered hand. The Pharisees watched Him,\neager to see what He would do. The Savior well knew that in healing\non the Sabbath He would be regarded as a transgressor, but He did\nnot hesitate to break down the wall of traditional requirements that\nbarricaded the Sabbath. Jesus bade the afflicted man stand forth, and\nthen asked, “Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do\nevil? to save life, or to kill?” It was a maxim among the Jews that\na failure to do good, when one had opportunity, was to do evil; to\n286 ToBeLikeJesus\nneglect to save life was to kill. Thus Jesus met the rabbis on their\nown ground. “But they held their peace. And when he had looked\nround about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of\ntheir hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And\nhe stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other”\n(Mark 3:4, 5).—The Desire of Ages, 285, 286."

How much then is a man better\nthan a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days”\n(Matthew 12:10-12).\nThe spies dared not answer Christ in the presence of the multi-\ntude, for fear of involving themselves in difficulty. They knew that\nHe had spoken the truth. Rather than violate their traditions, they\nwould leave a human being to suffer, while they would relieve a\nbrute because of the loss to the owner if it were neglected. Thus\ngreater care was shown for a dumb animal than for a person, who is\nmade in the image of God.\nThis illustrates the working of all false religions. They originate\nin the human desire to exalt self above God, but they result in de-\ngrading humanity below the brute. Every religion that wars against\nthe sovereignty of God defrauds human beings of the glory which\nwas theirs at the creation, and which is to be restored to them in\nChrist. Every false religion teaches its adherents to be careless of\nhuman needs, sufferings, and rights. The gospel places a high value\nupon humanity as the purchase of the blood of Christ, and it teaches\na tender regard for the wants and woes of humankind....\nWhen Jesus turned upon the Pharisees with the question whether\nit was lawful on the Sabbath day to do good or to do evil, to save\nlife or to kill, He confronted them with their own wicked purposes.\nThey were hunting His life with bitter hatred, while He was saving\nlife and bringing happiness to multitudes.

Was it more righteous to have murder in the heart\nupon God’s holy day rather than love, which finds expression in\ndeeds of mercy?\nIn the healing of the withered hand, Jesus condemned the custom\nof the Jews, and left the fourth commandment standing as God had\ngiven it. “It is lawful to do well on the sabbath days,” He declared.\nBy sweeping away the senseless restrictions of the Jews, Christ\nhonored the Sabbath, while those who complained of Him were\ndishonoring God’s holy day.—The Desire of Ages, 286, 287.\nThe Sabbath Designed to Bring Us Into Harmony [146]"

Ezekiel\n20:20, NKJV.\nIn Revelation 14, human beings are called upon to worship the\nCreator; and the prophecy brings to view a class that, as the result of\nthe threefold message, are keeping the commandments of God. One\nof these commandments points directly to God as the Creator. The\nfourth precept declares: “The seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord\nthy God: ... for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the\nsea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore\nthe Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it” (Exodus 20:10,\n11)....\n“The importance of the Sabbath as the memorial of creation\nis that it keeps ever present the true reason why worship is due to\nGod”—because He is the Creator, and we are His creatures. “The\nSabbath therefore lies at the very foundation of divine worship, for\nit teaches this great truth in the most impressive manner, and no\nother institution does this. The true ground of divine worship, not\nof that on the seventh day merely, but of all worship, is found in the\ndistinction between the Creator and His creatures. This great fact\ncan never become obsolete, and must never be forgotten.”—J. N.\nAndrews, History of the Sabbath, chap. 27.\nIt was to keep this truth ever before the minds of people that God\ninstituted the Sabbath in Eden; and so long as the fact that He is\nour Creator continues to be a reason why we should worship Him,\nso long the Sabbath will continue as its sign and memorial. Had\nthe Sabbath been universally kept, the thoughts and affections of\nhumans wouldhave been ledto the Creatoras the objectofreverence\nand worship, and there would never have been an idolater, an atheist,\nor an infidel.\n318 ToBeLikeJesus\nThe keeping of the Sabbath is a sign of loyalty to the true God,\n“him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains\nof waters.” It follows that the message which commands mortals to\nworship God and keep His commandments will especially call upon\nthem to keep the fourth commandment.—The Great Controversy,\n437, 438.\nThe Sabbath Not Jewish but Christ’s Holy Day, [161]"

Psalm 145:3, NKJV.\nInfidel geologists claim that the world is very much older than\nthe Bible record makes it. They reject the testimony of God’s Word\nbecause of those things which are to them evidences from the earth\nitself that it has existed tens of thousands of years. And many who\nprofess to believe the Bible are at a loss to account for wonderful\nthings which are found in the earth, with the view that Creation week\nwas only seven literal days, and that the world is now only about\nsix thousand years old. These, to free themselves from difficulties\nthrown in their way by infidel geologists, adopt the view that the\nsix days of Creation were six vast, indefinite periods, and the day\nof God’s rest was another indefinite period; making senseless the\nfourth commandment of God’s holy law. Some eagerly receive this\nposition; for it destroys the force of the fourth commandment, and\nthey feel a freedom from its claims upon them.\nBones of human beings and animals are found in the earth, in\nmountains and in valleys, showing that much larger humans and\nbeasts once existed. Instruments of warfare are sometimes found;\nalso petrified wood. Because the bones found are so much larger\nthan those ofhumans andanimals nowliving, orthathave existedfor\nmany generations past, some conclude that the earth was populated\nlong before the record of Creation by a race of beings vastly superior\nin size to those now living. Those who reason in this manner have\nlimited ideas of the size of people, animals, and trees, before the\nFlood, and of the great changes which then took place in the earth.\nWithout Bible history, geology can prove nothing.... When hu-\nman beings leave the Word of God, and seek to account for His cre-\native works upon natural principles, they are upon a boundless ocean\nof uncertainty. Just how God accomplished the work of Creation in\n306 ToBeLikeJesus\nsix literal days, He has never revealed to mortals. His creative works\nare as incomprehensible as His existence.—The Signs of the Times,"

He has tried to obscure the law of God, which in itself\nis very plain. He has manifested a special hatred against the fourth\nprecept of the Decalogue, because it defines the living God, the\nmaker of the heavens and the earth.

It was kept\nby all the patriarchs, from Abel to righteous Noah, to Abraham, to\nJacob. When the chosen people were in bondage in Egypt, many, in\nthe midst of prevailing idolatry, lost their knowledge of God’s law;\nbut when the Lord delivered Israel, He proclaimed His law in awful\ngrandeur to the assembled multitude, that they might know His will\nand fear and obey Him forever.\nFromthatdaytothepresenttheknowledgeofGod’slawhasbeen\npreserved in the earth, and the Sabbath of the fourth commandment\nhas been kept. Though the “man of sin” succeeded in trampling\nunderfoot God’s holy day, yet even in the period of his supremacy\nthere were, hidden in secret places, faithful souls who paid it honor.\nSince the Reformation, there have been some in every generation to\nmaintain its observance. Though often in the midst of reproach and\n310 ToBeLikeJesus\npersecution, a constant testimony has been borne to the perpetuity\nof the law of God and the sacred obligation of the creation Sabbath.\nThese truths, as presented in Revelation 14 in connection with\n“the everlasting gospel,” will distinguish the church of Christ at the\ntime of His appearing. For as the result of the threefold message it\nis announced: “Here are they that keep the commandments of God,\nandthefaithofJesus.”Andthismessageisthelasttobegiven before\nthe coming of the Lord.

Here their false ideas about the Sabbath were taught\nto the people. Great numbers came to worship at the Temple, and\nthus the rabbis’ teaching was spread far and wide. Christ wished\nto correct these errors. This was why He healed the man on the\nSabbath day, and told him to carry his bed. He knew that this act\nwould attract the attention of the rabbis, and thus would give Him\nan opportunity to instruct them. So it proved.

It was in harmony with the will and the work of God.\n“My Father worketh hitherto,” He said, “and I work” (John 5:17).\nGod works continually in sustaining every living thing.

Must the wheat and maize\nstop growing, and the trees and flowers put forth no bud or blossom\non the Sabbath?\nThen people would miss the fruits of the earth, and the blessings\nthat sustain their life. Nature must continue its work, or mortals\nwould die. And they also have a work to do on this day.

God does not desire His\n314 ToBeLikeJesus\ncreatures to sufferan hour’s pain that may be relieved on the Sabbath\nor any other day.\nHeaven’s work never ceases, and we should never rest from\ndoing good. Our own work the law forbids us to do on the rest\nday of the Lord. The toil for a livelihood must cease; no labor for\nworldly pleasure or profit is lawful upon that day. But the Sabbath is\nnot to be spent in useless inactivity. As God ceased from His labor\nof creating, and rested upon the Sabbath, so we are to rest.

Exodus 23:1,\nNKJV.\nI saw that the Lord still has something to do with the laws of the\nland. While Jesus is in the sanctuary, God’s restraining Spirit is felt\nby rulers and people. But Satan controls to a great extent the mass\nof the world, and were it not for the laws of the land, we should\nexperience much suffering. I was shown that when it is actually\nnecessary, and they are called upon to testify in a lawful manner, it\nis no violation of God’s Word for His children to solemnly take God\nto witness that what they say is the truth, and nothing but the truth.\nHuman beings are so corrupt that laws are made to throw the\nresponsibility upon their own heads. Some men and women do\nnot fear to lie to other people; but they have been taught, and the\nrestraining Spirit of God has impressed them, that it is a fearful thing\nto lie to God. The case of Ananias and Sapphira his wife is given\nfor an example. The matter is carried from humans to God, so that\nif one bears false witness, it is not to mortals, but to the great God,\nwho reads the heart, and knows the exact truth in every case. Our\nlaws make it a high crime to take a false oath. God has often visited\njudgment upon false swearers, and even while the oath was on their\nlips, the destroying angel has cut them down. This was to prove a\nterror to evildoers.\nI saw that if there is anyone on earth who can consistently testify\nunder oath, it is Christians. They live in the light of God’s coun-\ntenance. They grow strong in His strength. And when matters of\nimportance must be decided by law, there is no one who can so well\nappeal to God as the Christian....\nJesus submitted to the oath in the hour of His trial.

The stewards of God must be\nmore wise, lay their plans, and prepare themselves to withstand\nSatan’s devices; for he is to make greater efforts than ever before.—\nTestimonies for the Church 1:202, 203."

Enter into the joy of your lord.” Matthew 25:21,\nNKJV.\n[Brother C] is in a responsible position, but if the members of the\nfamily to which he has allied himself in marriage will prove true to\nhim, they will influence him to become a wise steward of his Lord’s\ngoods. Then he will bestow his means as if in the view of the whole\nuniverse of heaven. He will not participate in any unlawful scheme\nfor making money, but will move with an eye single to the glory of\nGod. He will eschew all petty tricks and avoid all mean, dishonest\ndevices, and will do nothing that will [in] any way work against\nthe cultivation of true piety. He will realize that all his business\ntransactions lie within the domain of God.\nWe must not lose sight of the fact that stewards are to trade with\ntheir Lord’s goods, and that they are handling a sacred responsibility.\nThe Bible requires that people buy and sell and transact all their\nbusiness with as keen a sense of their religious obligation as they\nhave when offering up petitions to their heavenly Father, asking for\nstrength and grace. The Lord has not left any to do as they please\nwith their goods, and to give as impulse shall dictate, or as friends\nmay demand. The money they handle is not theirs, and is not to be\nexpended unnecessarily, forthe vineyard of the Lord is to be worked,\nand its working requires the expenditure of means.\nNow is our day of trust, and the day of reckoning is yet to come.\nThe Lord has entrusted means to His stewards to be used wisely, for\nall are moral agents and are required to bear responsibilities. Our\nvaried trusts are given in proportion to our ability to use, but we are\nnot to use God’s means merely for the gratification of selfish desires,\nand as inclination may dictate."

They assemble with God’s people upon the\nSabbath, with their clothing dusty, and soiled, and even with gaping\nrents in them, and placed upon their persons in a slovenly manner.\nThis class, if they had an engagement to meet a friend honored\nby the world, and they wished to be especially favored by him or her,\nwould exert themselves to appear ... with the best apparel that could\nbe obtained; for this friend would feel insulted were they to come ...\nwith hair uncombed, and garments uncleanly, and in disorder.\nYet these persons think that it is no matter in what dress they\nappear, or what is the condition of their persons, when they meet\nupon the Sabbath to worship the great God. They assemble in\nHis house, which is as the audience chamber of the Most High,\nwhere heavenly angels are in attendance, with but little respect,\nor reverence, as their persons and clothing indicate. Their whole\nappearance typifies the character of such men and women.\nThe favorite theme of this class is pride of dress. Decency, taste,\nand order, they regard as pride. And according to the dress of these\nmistaken souls will be their conversation, their acts, and their deal.\nThey are careless, and often low in their conversation at their homes,\nGodNotPleasedWithTastelessDisorder,July5 393\namong their brethren and sisters, and before the world. The dress,\nand its arrangement upon the person, is generally found to be the\nindex of the man or the woman. Those who are careless and untidy\nin dress are seldom elevated in their conversation, and possess but\nlittle refinement of feelings. They sometimes consider oddity and\ncoarseness, humility....\nOur God is a God of order, and He is not in any degree pleased\nwith distraction, with filthiness, or with sin.—Selected Messages\n2:475, 476."

Mark 4:18, 19, NKJV.\nChrist specified the things that are dangerous to the soul. As\nrecorded by Mark, He mentions the cares of this world, the deceitful-\nness of riches, and the lusts of other things. Luke specifies the cares,\nriches, and pleasures of this life. These are what choke the word, the\ngrowing spiritual seed. The soul ceases to draw nourishment from\nChrist, and spirituality dies out of the heart.\n“The cares of this world.” No class is free from the temptation to\nworldly care. To the poor, toil and deprivation and the fear of want\nbring perplexities and burdens. To the rich come fear of loss and a\nmultitude of anxious cares. Many of Christ’s followers forget the\nlesson He has bidden us learn from the flowers of the field. They\ndo not trust to His constant care. Christ cannot carry their burden,\nbecause they do not cast it upon Him....\nMany who might be fruitful in God’s service become bent on\nacquiring wealth. Their whole energy is absorbed in business enter-\nprises, and they feel obliged to neglect things of a spiritual nature.\nThus they separate themselves from God.... We are to labor that\nwe may impart to those in need. Christians must work, they must\nengage in business, and they can do this without committing sin.\nBut many become so absorbed in business that they have no time for\nprayer, no time for the study of the Bible, no time to seek and serve\nGod.\nAt times the longings of the soul go out for holiness and heaven;\nbut there is no time to turn aside from the din of the world to listen\nto the majestic and authoritative utterances of the Spirit of God.\nThe things of eternity are made subordinate, the things of the world\nTakeTimeforPrayerandtheWord,July29 441\nsupreme. Itis impossible forthe seedofthe Wordto bring forthfruit;\nfor the life of the soul is given to nourish the thorns of worldliness.\nAnd many who are working with a very different purpose fall\ninto a like error. They are working for others’ good; their duties\nare pressing, their responsibilities are many, and they allow their\nlabor to crowd out devotion.... They walk apart from Christ, their\nlife is not pervaded by His grace, and the characteristics of self are\nrevealed.—Christ’s Object Lessons, 51, 52.\n[224] Study Christ’s Words, Not Human Opinions, July\nFor the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth\ncame through Jesus Christ. John 1:17, NKJV.\nJesus was the light of the world. He came forth from God with\na message of hope and salvation to the fallen children of Adam. If\nmen and women would but receive Him as their personal Savior, He\npromised to restore to them the image of God, and to redeem all that\nhad been lost through sin. He presented to human beings the truth,\nwithout one thread of interwoven error. When He taught, His words\ncame with authority; for He spoke with positive knowledge of the\ntruth.\nThe teaching of mortals is wholly different from the teaching of\nChrist. There is a constant tendency on the part of humans to present\ntheir own theories and opinions as matter worthy of attention, even\nwhen they have no foundation in truth. They are very tenacious for\ntheir erroneous ideas and idle opinions. They will hold firmly to\nthe traditions of humanity, and defend them as vigorously as if they\nwere the veritable truth. Jesus declared that everyone that was of the\ntruth would hear His voice.\nHow much more power would attend the preaching of the Word\ntoday if ministers dwelt less upon human theories and arguments\nand far more upon the lessons of Christ and upon practical godli-\nness. He who had stood in the counsel of God, who had dwelt in\nHis presence, was well acquainted with the origin and elements of\ntruth, and understood its relation and importance to humanity. He\npresented to the world the plan of salvation, and unfolded truth of\nthe highest order, even the words of eternal life.\nPatriarchs, prophets, and apostles spoke as they were moved\nupon by the Holy Ghost, and they plainly stated that they spoke not\nby their own power, nor in their own name.

There is no speech nor\nlanguage, where their voice is not heard.” Some may suppose that\nthese grand things in the natural world are God.

It sends strong roots deep down into the earth, and\nstrikes down further and still further in search of a still stronger hold.\nAnd in the fierce blast of the tempest, it stands firm, held by its\nnetwork of cables beneath.\nSo Christians strike roots deep into Christ. They have faith in\ntheir Redeemer. They know in whom they believe. They are fully\npersuadedthatJesus is the Son ofGodandthe Saviorofsinners. The\ngoodly sound of the gospel is received without conflicting doubts.\nThe roots of faith strike deep down.

They hold that\ncertain properties are imparted to matter, and it is then left to act\nthrough its own inherent power; and that the operations of nature\nare carried on in harmony with fixed laws that God Himself cannot\ninterfere with. This is false science, and is sustained by nothing in\nthe Word of God.\nNature is not self-acting; it is the servant of its Creator.

Nature testifies of an intelligence, a\npresence, an active agency, that works in, and through, and above its\nlaws. There is in nature the continual working of the Father and the\nSon. Said Christ, “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.”\nGod has finished His creative work, but His energy is still ex-\nerted in upholding the objects of His creation. It is not because the\nmechanism thathas once been set in motion continues its work by its\nown inherent energy that the pulse beats and breath follows breath;\nbut every breath, every pulsation of the heart, is an evidence of the\nall-pervading care of Him in whom we live and have our being.\nIt is not because of inherent power that year by year the earth\nproduces its bounties and continues its motion around the sun.

Psalm 69:34,\n35, NKJV.\nThe same creative energy that brought the world into existence is\nstill exerted in upholding the universe and continuing the operations\nof nature. The hand of God guides the planets in their orderly march\nthrough the heavens. It is not because of inherent power that year\nby year the earth continues its motion round the sun, and produces\nits bounties. The word of God controls the elements. He covers\nthe heavens with clouds, and prepares rain for the earth. He makes\nthe valleys fruitful, and “grass to grow upon the mountains.” It is\nthrough His power that vegetation flourishes; that the leaves appear\nand the flowers bloom.\nThe whole natural world is designed to be an interpreter of the\nthings of God. To Adam and Eve in their Eden home, nature was full\nof the knowledge of God, teeming with divine instruction. It was\nvocalwiththe voice ofwisdom to theirattentive ears. Wisdom spoke\nto the eye, and was received into the heart; for they communed with\nGod in His created works. As soon as the holy pair transgressed the\nlaw of the Most High, the brightness from the face of God departed\nfrom the face ofnature. Nature is nowmarredanddefiledbysin. But\nGod’s object lessons are not obliterated; even now, rightly studied\nand interpreted, [nature] speaks of the Creator.\nAs divine truth is revealed in Holy Writ, so it is reflected, as\nfrom a mirror, in the face of nature; and through His creation we\nbecome acquainted with the Creator. And so the book of nature\nbecomes a great lesson book, which instructors who are wise can\nuse, in connection with the Scriptures, to guide lost sheep back to\nthe fold of God. As the works of God are studied, the Holy Spirit\nflashes conviction into the mind. It is not the conviction which\n492 ToBeLikeJesus\nlogical reasoning produces; but unless the mind has become too dark\nto know God, the eye too dim to see Him, the ear too dull to hear\nHis voice, a deeper meaning is grasped, and the sublime, spiritual\ntruths of the written Word are impressed on the heart.\nThe most effective way to teach the heathen who know not God\nis through His works. In this way, far more readily than by any other\nmethod, they can be made to realize the difference between their\nidols, the works of their own hands, and the true God, the Maker of\nheaven and earth.—Special Testimonies On Education, 58-60.\nRich Blessings From a Sabbath for the Land, [250]"

You shall neither sow your field nor\nprune your vineyard. Leviticus 25:3, 4, NKJV.\nThe feast of tabernacles, or harvest festival, with its offerings\nfrom orchard and field, its week’s encampment in the leafy booths,\nits social reunions, the sacred memorial service, and the generous\nhospitality to God’s workers, the Levites of the sanctuary, and to His\nchildren, the strangers and the poor, uplifted all minds in gratitude\nto Him who had crowned the year with His goodness, and whose\npaths dropped fatness.\nBy the devout in Israel, fully a month of every year was occupied\nin this way. It was a period free from care and labor, and almost\nwholly devoted, in the truest sense, to purposes of education.\nIn apportioning the inheritance of His people, it was God’s pur-\npose to teach them, and through them the people of aftergenerations,\ncorrect principles concerning the ownership of the land. The land\nof Canaan was divided among the whole people, the Levites only,\nas ministers of the sanctuary, being excepted. Though one might\nfor a season dispose of his possession, he could not barter away the\ninheritance of his children. When able to do so, he was at liberty at\nany time to redeem it; debts were remitted every seventh year, and\nin the fiftieth, or year of jubilee, all landed property reverted to the\noriginal owner. Thus every family was secured in its possession, and\na safeguard was afforded against the extremes either of wealth or of\npoverty.\nBy the distribution of the land among the people, God provided\nfor them, as for the dwellers in Eden, the occupation most favorable\nto development—the care of plants and animals. A further provision\n494 ToBeLikeJesus\nfor education was the suspension of agricultural labor every seventh\nyear, the land lying fallow, and its spontaneous products being left to\nthe poor. Thus was given opportunity for more extended study, for\nsocial interaction and worship, and for the exercise of benevolence,\nso often crowded out by life’s cares and labors.\nWere the principles of God’s laws regarding the distribution of\nproperty carried out in the world today, how different would be the\ncondition of the people!—Education, 42-44."

Certain classes of Hebrew slaves—all who did not receive\ntheir liberty in the sabbatical year—were now set free.\nBut that which especially distinguished the year of jubilee was\nthe reversion of all landed property to the family of the original\npossessor.

Neither was he to sell his land unless poverty compelled\nhim to do so, and then, whenever he or any of his kindred might\ndesire to redeem it, the purchaser must not refuse to sell it; and if\nunredeemed, it would revert to its first possessor or his heirs in the\nyear of jubilee....\nThe people were to be impressed with the fact that it was God’s\nland which they were permitted to possess for a time; that He was\nthe rightful owner, the original proprietor, and that He would have\nspecial consideration made for the poor and unfortunate.

It is impossible for one to retain the favor\nand love of God, and enjoy communion with Him, and still feel no\nresponsibility for the souls for whom Christ died, who are in error\nand darkness, perishing in their sins.\nIf those who profess to be followers of Christ neglect to shine\nas lights in the world, the vital power will leave them, and they will\nbecome cold and Christless. The spell of indifference will be upon\nthem, a deathlike sluggishness of soul, which will make them bodies\nof death instead of living representatives of Jesus.

They are waiting for that peculiar change\nthat they have been led to believe is connected with conversion.\nAfter a time some of these do receive evidence of their accep-\ntance with God, and are then led to identify themselves with His\npeople. And they date their conversion from this time. But I have\nbeen shown that they were adopted into the family of God before\nthat time. God accepted them when they became weary of sin, and\nhaving lost their desire for worldly pleasures, resolved to seek God\nearnestly. But, failing to understand the simplicity of the plan of\nsalvation, they lost many privileges and blessings which they might\nhave claimed had they only believed, when they first turned to God,\nthat He had accepted them.\nOthers fall into a more dangerous error. They are governed by\nimpulse. Their sympathies are stirred, and they regard this flight\n532 ToBeLikeJesus\nof feeling as an evidence that they are accepted by God and are\nconverted. But the principles of their life are not changed.

It should ever be kept prominent that the great object to\nbe attained through this channel is not only health, but perfection,\nand the spirit of holiness, which cannot be attained with diseased\nbodies and minds. This object cannot be secured by working merely\nfrom the worldling’s standpoint.

In order to do this they\nmust use aright every power of mind, soul, and body. They cannot\nafford to waste any mental or physical strength.\nThe question of how to preserve the health is one of primary\nimportance. When we study this question in the fear of God, we\nshalllearn thatitis best, forbothourphysicalhealthandourspiritual\nadvancement, to observe simplicity in diet. Let us patiently study\nthis question. We need knowledge and judgment in order to move\nwisely in this matter. Nature’s laws are notto be resisted, butobeyed.\nThose who have received instruction regarding the evils of the\nuse of flesh meats, tea and coffee, and rich and unhealthful food\npreparations, and who are determined to make a covenant with God\nby sacrifice, will not continue to indulge their appetite for food that\nthey know to be unhealthful. God demands that the appetite be\ncleansed, and that self-denial be practiced in regard to those things\nwhich are not good. This is a work that will have to be done before\nHis people can stand before Him a perfected people.\nThe remnant people of God must be a converted people. The\npresentation of this message is to result in the conversion and sanc-\ntification of souls. We are to feel the power of the Spirit of God\nin this movement.

There are conditions to be observed\nby all who would preserve health. All should learn what these\nconditions are.

It is our work to present the sick and suffering to Christ\nin the arms of our faith. We should teach them to believe in the\nGreat Healer. We should lay hold on His promise, and pray for\nthe manifestation of His power. The very essence of the gospel is\nrestoration, and the Savior would have us bid the sick, the hopeless,\nand the afflicted take hold upon His strength.\nConditionsforGoodHealthMustBeObserved,October11 587\nThe powerof love was in all Christ’s healing, and only by partak-\ning of that love, through faith, can we be instruments for His work.\nIf we neglect to link ourselves in divine connection with Christ, the\ncurrent of life-giving energy cannot flow in rich streams from us to\nthe people....\nTo take His yoke is one of the first conditions of receiving His\npower.

John 6:51, NKJV.\nThe incense, ascending with the prayers of Israel, represents the\nmerits and intercession of Christ, His perfect righteousness, which\nthrough faith is imputed to His people, and which can alone make\nthe worship of sinful beings acceptable to God. Before the veil of\nthe most holy place was an altar of perpetual intercession, before\nthe holy, an altar of continual atonement. By blood and by incense\nGod was to be approached—symbols pointing to the great Mediator,\nthrough whom sinners may approach Jehovah, and through whom\nalone mercy and salvation can be granted to the repentant, believing\nsoul.\nAs the priests morning and evening entered the holy place at\nthe time of incense, the daily sacrifice was ready to be offered upon\nthe altar in the court without. This was a time of intense interest to\nthe worshipers who assembled at the tabernacle. Before entering\ninto the presence of God through the ministration of the priest, they\nwere to engage in earnest searching of heart and confession of sin.\nThey united in silent prayer, with their faces toward the holy place.\nThus their petitions ascended with the cloud of incense, while faith\nlaid hold upon the merits of the promised Savior prefigured by the\natoning sacrifice.\nThe hours appointed for the morning and the evening sacrifice\nwere regarded as sacred, and they came to be observed as the set\ntime for worship throughout the Jewish nation. And when in later\ntimes the Jews were scattered as captives in distant lands, they still at\nthe appointed hour turned their faces toward Jerusalem and offered\nup their petitions to the God of Israel.

Luke 15:7, NKJV.\nThe minister is to be a shepherd. Our Redeemer is called the\nchief Shepherd. The apostle writes, “Now the God of peace, that\nbrought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd\nof the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make\nyou perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that\nwhich is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ.” However\nlowly, however elevated we may be, whether we are in the shadow\nof adversity or in the sunshine of prosperity, we are His sheep, the\nflock of His pasture, and under the care of the chief Shepherd.\nBut the chief Shepherd has His undershepherds, whom He has\ndelegated to care for His sheep and lambs. The great Shepherd never\nloses one from His care, is never indifferent even to the feeblest one\nof His flock. The beautiful parable that Christ gave of the one lost\nsheep, of the shepherd that left the ninety and nine to go in search of\nthat which was lost, illustrates the care of the great Shepherd. He\ndid not look carelessly over the sheep of the fold, and say, “I have\nninety and nine, and it will cost me too much trouble to go in search\nof the straying one; let it come back, and I will open the door of the\nsheepfold and let it in; but I cannot go after it.”\nNo; for no sooner does the sheep go astray than the counte-\nnance of the shepherd is filled with grief and anxiety. He counts\nand recounts the flock, and when he is certain that one sheep is\nlost, he slumbereth not. He leaves the ninety and nine within the\nfold; however dark and tempestuous the night, however perilous and\nunpleasant the way, however long and tedious the search, he does\nnot weary, he does not falter, until the lost is found.\nJesus,theChiefShepherd,KnowsEachSheep,December1 693\nBut when it is found, does he act indifferently? Does he call\nthe sheep, and command the straying one to follow him? Does he\nthreaten and beat it, or drive it before him, recounting the bitterness\nand discomfiture and anxiety that he has had on its account? No;\nhe lays the weary, exhausted, wandering sheep on his shoulder, and\nwithcheerfulgratitudethathissearchhasnotbeen in vain, hereturns\nit to the fold.

John 17:18, 19, NKJV.\nIn the parable of the lost sheep, Christ teaches that salvation does\nnot come through our seeking after God but through God’s seeking\nafterus. “There is none thatunderstandeth, there is none thatseeketh\nafter God. They are all gone out of the way” (Romans 3:11, 12). We\ndo not repent in order that God may love us, but He reveals to us\nHis love in order that we may repent....\nThe rabbis had a saying that there is rejoicing in heaven when\none who has sinned against God is destroyed; but Jesus taught that\nto God the work of destruction is a strange work. That in which all\nheaven delights is the restoration of God’s own image in the souls\nwhom He has made.\nWhen some who have wandered far in sin seek to return to God,\nthey will encounter criticism and distrust. There are those who will\ndoubt whether their repentance is genuine, or will whisper, “They\nhave no stability; I do not believe that they will hold out.”\nThese persons are doing not the work of God but the work of\nSatan, who is the accuser of the brethren. Through their criticisms\nthe wicked one hopes to discourage those souls, and to drive them\nstill farther from hope and from God. Let the repenting sinners con-\ntemplate the rejoicing in heaven over the return of the one that was\nlost. Let them rest in the love of God and in no case be disheartened\nby the scorn and suspicion of the Pharisees.\nThe rabbis understood Christ’s parable as applying to the publi-\ncans and sinners; but it has also a wider meaning. By the lost sheep\nChrist represents not only the individual sinner but the one world\nthat has apostatized and has been ruined by sin. This world is but an\natom in the vast dominions over which God presides, yet this little\nWhenSinnersRepent,HeavenRejoices,December7 705\nfallen world—the one lost sheep—is more precious in His sight than\nare the ninety and nine that went not astray from the fold.\nChrist, the loved Commander in the heavenly courts, stooped\nfrom His high estate, laid aside the glory that He had with the Father,\nin order to save the one lost world. For this He left the sinless\nworlds on high, the ninety and nine that loved Him, and came to\nthis earth, to be “wounded for our transgressions” and “bruised for\nour iniquities” (Isaiah 53:5). God gave Himself in His Son that He\nmight have the joy of receiving back the sheep that was lost....\nEvery soul whom Christ has rescued is called to work in His\nname for the saving of the lost.

Multitudes sorrow that they have sinned and even make an\noutward reformation because they fear that their wrongdoing will\nbring suffering upon themselves. But this is not repentance in the\nBible sense. They lament the suffering rather than the sin. Such was\nthe grief of Esau when he saw that the birthright was lost to him\nforever.

But I refrain, lest anyone should think of\nme above what he sees me to be or hears from me. 2\nCorinthians 12:6, NKJV.\nThe followers of Christ are to become like Him—by the grace of\nGod to form characters in harmony with the principles of His holy\nlaw. This is Bible sanctification.\nThis work can be accomplished only through faith in Christ,\nby the power of the indwelling Spirit of God.... The Christian will\nfeel the promptings of sin, but will maintain a constant warfare\nagainst it. Here is where Christ’s help is needed. Human weakness\nbecomes united to divine strength, and faith exclaims: “Thanks be\nto God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ”\n(1 Corinthians 15:57).\nThe Scriptures plainly show that the work of sanctification is\nprogressive. When in conversion the sinner finds peace with God\nthrough the blood of the atonement, the Christian life has but just\nbegun. Nowhe orshe is to “go on unto perfection;” to growup“unto\nthe measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.” ... Peter sets\nbefore us the steps by which Bible sanctification is to be attained:\n“Giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowl-\nedge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience;\nand to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and\nto brotherly kindness charity.... If ye do these things, ye shall never\nfall” (2 Peter 1:5-10).\nThose who experience the sanctification of the Bible will man-\nifest a spirit of humility. Like Moses, they have had a view of the\nawful majesty of holiness, and they see their own unworthiness in\ncontrast with the purity and exalted perfection of the Infinite One.\nThe prophet Daniel was an example of true sanctification. His long\nBibleSanctificationInvolvesHumilityandConstantGrowth,December18727\nlife was filled up with noble service for his Master. He was a man\n“greatly beloved” (Daniel 10:11) of Heaven. Yet instead of claiming\nto be pure and holy, this honored prophet identified himself with\nthe really sinful of Israel as he pleaded before God in behalf of his\npeople.... When at a later time the Son of God appeared, to give\nhim instruction, Daniel says: “My comeliness was turned in me into\ncorruption, and I retained no strength” (Verse 8)....\nThere can be no self-exaltation, no boastful claim to freedom\nfrom sin, on the part of those who walk in the shadow of Calvary’s\ncross. They feel that it was their sin which caused the agony that\nbroke the heart of the Son of God, and this thought will lead them\nto self-abasement. Those who live nearest to Jesus discern most\nclearly the frailty and sinfulness of humanity, and their only hope is\nin the merit of a crucified and risen Savior.—The Great Controversy,\n469-471.\n[371] Repentance to Be Followed by Change of Character,"

No human invention can ever find a remedy for the sinning\nsoul. Only by repentance and humiliation, a submission to the divine\nrequirements, can the work of grace be performed. Iniquity is so\noffensive in the sight of God, whom the sinner has so long insulted\nand wronged, that a repentance commensurate with the character of\nthe sins committed often produces an agony of spirit hard to bear.\nNothinglessthanapracticalacceptanceandapplicationofdivine\ntruth opens the kingdom of God to human beings. Only a pure and\nlowly heart, obedient and loving, firm in the faith and service of\nthe Most High, can enter there. Jesus also declares that as “Moses\nlifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man\nbe lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but\nhave eternal life.”\nRepentancetoBeFollowedbyChangeofCharacter,December19 729\nThe serpent in the wilderness was lifted up on a pole before the\npeople, that all who had been stung unto death by the fiery serpent\nmight look upon this brazen serpent, a symbol of Christ, and be\ninstantly healed. But they must look in faith, or it would be of no\navail. Just so must people today look upon the Son of man as their\nSavior unto eternal life. The human race had separated itself from\nGod by sin. Christ brought His divinity to earth, veiled by humanity,\nin order to rescue the race from its lost condition. Human nature is\nvile, and the character must be changed before it can harmonize with\nthe pure and holy in God’s immortal kingdom. This transformation"

Acts 5:31,\nNKJV.\nThere are many who have erroneous ideas in regard to the nature\nofrepentance. TheythinkthattheycannotcometoChristunlessthey\nfirst repent, and that repentance prepares them for the forgiveness\nof their sins. It is true that repentance does precede the forgiveness\nof sins; for it is only the broken and contrite heart that will feel the\nneed of a Savior.\nBut must sinners wait until they have repented before they can\ncome to Jesus? Is repentance to be made an obstacle between the\nsinner and the Savior? Jesus has said, “And I, if I be lifted up from\nthe earth, will draw all men unto me.” Christ is constantly drawing\npeople to Himself, while Satan is as diligently seeking by every\nimaginable device to draw them away from their Redeemer. Christ\nmust be revealed to sinners as the Savior dying for the sins of the\nworld; and as they behold the Lamb of God on the cross of Calvary,\nthe mysteries of redemption begin to unfold to the mind, and the\ngoodness of God leads to repentance.\nAlthough the plan of salvation calls for the deepest study of the\nphilosopher, it is not too deep for the comprehension of a child. In\ndying for sinners, Christ manifested a love that is incomprehensible;\nand in beholding this love the heart is impressed, the conscience is\naroused, and the soul is led to inquire, “What is sin, that it should\nrequire such a sacrifice for the redemption of its victim?” ... The\napostle Paul gave instruction in regard to the plan of salvation. He\ndeclares, “I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have\nshewed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,\ntestifyingbothtotheJews, andalsoto theGreeks, repentancetoward\nGod, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.” John, speaking of the\nBothRepentanceandForgivenessAreGiftsFromChrist,December20 731\nSavior, says, “Ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins;\nand in him is no sin.” ...\nSinners must come to Christ because they see Him as their\nSavior, their only helper, that they may be enabled to repent; for if\nthey could repent without coming to Christ, they could also be saved\nwithout Christ. It is the virtue that goes forth from Christ that leads\nto genuine repentance.... Repentance is as much the gift of Christ as\nis forgiveness, and it cannot be found in the heart where Jesus has\nnot been at work. We can no more repent without the Spirit of Christ\nto awaken the conscience than we can be pardoned without Christ.\nChrist draws the sinner by the exhibition of His love upon the cross,\nandthis softens the heart, impresses the mind, andinspires contrition"

Ezekiel 11:19, 20, NKJV.\nThe Lord has plainly revealed His will concerning the salvation\nof the sinner.

He belonged to a\nChristian named Philemon, a member of the Colossian church. But\nhe had robbed his master and fled to Rome.... In the kindness of his\nheart, the apostle sought to relieve the poverty and distress of the\nwretched fugitive, and then endeavored to shed the light of truth into\nhis darkened mind. Onesimus listened attentively to the words of\nlife which he had once despised, and was converted to the faith of\nChrist. He now confessed his sin against his master, and gratefully\naccepted the counsel of the apostle.\nHe had endeared himself to Paul by his piety, meekness, and\nsincerity, no less than by his tendercare forthe apostle’s comfortand\nhis zeal to promote the work of the gospel. Paul saw in him traits of\ncharacter that would render him a useful helper in missionary labor,\nand he would gladly have kept him at Rome. But he would not do\nthis without the full consent of Philemon.\nHe therefore decided that Onesimus should at once return to his\nmaster.... It was a severe test for this servant to thus deliver himself\nup to the master he had wronged; but he had been truly converted,\nand, painful as it was, he did not shrink from this duty. Paul made\nOnesimus the bearer of a letter to Philemon, in which he with great\ndelicacy and kindness pleaded the cause of the repentant slave, and\nintimated his own wishes concerning him....\nHe requests Philemon to receive him as his own child.

There is earnest warfare before all who would subdue the evil\ntendencies that strive for the mastery.\nThe work of preparation is an individual work. We are not saved\nin groups. The purity and devotion of one will not offset the want of\nthese qualities in another. Though all nations are to pass in judgment\nbefore God, yet He will examine the case of each individual with\nas close and searching scrutiny as if there were not another being\n746 ToBeLikeJesus\nupon the earth. Everyone must be tested, and found without spot or\nwrinkle or any such thing.\nSolemn are the scenes connected with the closing work of the\natonement. Momentous are the interests involved therein. The\njudgment is now passing in the sanctuary above.... Soon—none\nknow how soon—it will pass to the cases of the living....When the\nwork of the investigative judgment closes, the destiny of all will\nhave been decided for life or death. Probation is ended a short time\nbefore the appearing of the Lord in the clouds of heaven. Christ in\nthe Revelation, looking forward to that time, declares: ... “Behold,\nI come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man\naccording as his work shall be.”—The Gospel Herald, August 1910."

        "content": "Perhaps everyone will listen and turn from his evil way, that I\nmay relent concerning the calamity which I purpose to bring\non them because of the evil of their doings. Jeremiah 26:3,\nNKJV.\n[The apostle Paul writes that] “I had not known sin, but by the\nlaw: forI had notknown lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not\ncovet.” ... The law which promised life to the obedient pronounced\ndeath upon the transgressor. “Wherefore,” he says, “the law is holy,\nand the commandment holy, and just, and good.”\nHow wide the contrast between these words of Paul and those\nthat come from many of the pulpits of today. The people are taught\nthat obedience to God’s law is not necessary to salvation; that they\nhave only to believe in Jesus, and they are safe. Without the law,\nhuman beings have no conviction of sin, and feel no need of repen-\ntance. Not seeing their lost condition as violators of God’s law, they\ndo not feel their need of the atoning blood of Christ as their only\nhope of salvation.\nThe law of God is an agent in every genuine conversion. There\ncan be no true repentance without conviction of sin. The Scriptures\ndeclare that “sin is the transgression of the law,” and that “by the\nlaw is the knowledge of sin.”\nIn order to see their guilt, sinners must test their character by\nGod’s great standard of righteousness. To discover their defects,\nthey must look into the mirror of the divine statutes. But while the\nlaw reveals their sins, it provides no remedy. The gospel of Christ\nalone can offer pardon. In order to stand forgiven, sinners must\nexercise repentance toward God, whose law has been transgressed,\nand faith in Christ, their atoning sacrifice.\nWithout true repentance, there can be no true conversion. Many\nare deceived here, and too often their entire experience proves to be\n748 ToBeLikeJesus\na deception. This is why so many who are joined to the church have\nnever been joined to Christ.\n“The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to\nthe law of God, neither indeed can be.” In the new birth, the heart\nis renewed by divine grace, and brought into harmony with God as\nit is brought into subjection to His law. When this mighty change\nhas taken place, the sinner has passed from death unto life, from sin\nunto holiness, from transgression and rebellion to obedience and\nloyalty. The old life of alienation from God has ended; the new\nlife of reconciliation, of faith and love, has begun. Then will “the\nrighteousness of the law” “be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the\nflesh, but after the Spirit.”—The Spirit of Prophecy 4:297, 298.\nChrist’s Robe of Righteousness Is for the Repentant, [382]"

        "content": "Now therefore, amend your ways and your doings, and obey\nthe voice of the Lord your God; then the Lord will relent\nconcerning the doom that He has pronounced against you.\nJeremiah 26:13, NKJV.\nAlthough as sinners we are under the condemnation of the law,\nyet Christ, by His obedience rendered to the law, claims for the\nrepentant soul the merit of His own righteousness. In order to obtain\nthe righteousness of Christ, it is necessary for the sinner to know\nwhat that repentance is which works a radical change of mind and\nspirit and action. The work of transformation must begin in the\nheart, and manifest its power through every faculty of the being; but\nhuman beings are not capable of originating such a repentance as\nthis, and can experience it alone through Christ, who ascended up\non high, led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto humanity.\nWho is desirous of becoming truly repentant? What must they\ndo? They must come to Jesus, just as they are, without delay. They\nmust believe that the word of Christ is true, and, believing the\npromise, ask, that they may receive. When sincere desire prompts\npeople to pray, they will not pray in vain. The Lord will fulfill His\nword, and will give the Holy Spirit to lead to repentance toward God\nand faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. They will pray and watch,\nand put away their sins, making manifest their sincerity by the vigor\nof their endeavor to obey the commandments of God. With prayer\nthey will mingle faith, and not only believe in but obey the precepts\nof the law. They will announce themselves as on Christ’s side of the\nquestion. They will renounce all habits and associations that tend to\ndraw the heart from God.\nAll sinners who would become children of God must receive\nthe truth that repentance and forgiveness are to be obtained through\nnothing less than the atonement of Christ. Assured of this, they must\n750 ToBeLikeJesus\nput forth an effort in harmony with the work done for them, and with\nunwearied entreaty they must supplicate the throne of grace, that the\nrenovating power of God may come into their souls.\nChrist pardons none but the penitent, but whom He pardons\nHe first makes penitent. The provision made is complete, and the\neternal righteousness of Christ is placed to the account of every\nbelieving soul. The costly, spotless robe, woven in the loom of\nheaven, has been provided for the repenting, believing sinner, and\neveryone may say: “I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall\nbe joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of\nsalvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness” (Isaiah\n61:10).—Selected Messages, book 1, 393, 394.\nAll Who Repent Will Be Forgiven and Accepted, [383]"

        "content": "Foreword\nTo be like Jesus—this is the goal set forth by John the beloved:\n“Whoever says, ‘I abide in Him,’ ought to walk just as He walked”\n(1 John 2:6, NRSV). And Peter declared: “Christ also suffered for\nus, leaving us an example, that ye should follow His steps” (1 Peter\n2:21).\nIn support of this challenging objective, Ellen White wrote:\n“Talk as Christ talked. Work as Christ worked. We must look to\nChrist and live. Catching sight of His loveliness, we long to practice\nthe virtues and righteousness of Christ.” 1\nThepresentvolume, preparedintheofficesoftheEllenG. White\nEstate, is designed to help readers fix their eyes on Jesus, noting how\nHe lived, studying His attitudes and practices, and encouraging them\nto follow His example. How important was prayer in His life? How\ndid He relate to inspired writings? How did He use time and other\nGod-given talents? What was His attitude toward the natural world,\ntoward the moral law, toward healthful living? The daily readings\nare grouped around these and other practical topics month by month,\nhelping to make clear that salvation involves much more than simply\nsaying, “I believe.” It means loving Jesus, obeying Him, and seeking\nto be like Him.\nThe devotional readings have been selected from a wide range\nof Ellen White articles, books, and letters, written over a span of\nmany decades. To confine them to a single page, repetitive or less-\npertinent portions of the original message have been omitted, but\nthese omissions, indicated by marks of ellipsis, have in no way\ndistorted or changed the meaning of the original passage.\nMost of the texts used at the beginning of the daily readings are\nquoted from the New King James Version of the Bible, but a few\nhave been taken from the New Revised Standard Version because\nin these texts gender-inclusive language sets forth more precisely\nthe meaning of the Bible writer. For the same reason, without\n1TheUpwardLook,344.\nxv\nxvi ToBeLikeJesus\nmaking any change in Mrs. White’s thought this book uses inclusive\nlanguage where it is clear that Ellen White meant to include both\nmales and females in a passage.\nDuring a difficult experience in her 70-year ministry Ellen White\nwrote: “Jesus is my precious Savior. I want to copy the pattern. How\nexact in principle and upright in conduct was He! He gave no place\nto Satan when he was tempted. How wide awake He had to be to\ndiscern the tempter’s wiles. Oh, if we would only walk and work as\nJesus worked, how strict would be all our transactions with believers\nand unbelievers;\n[6] How tender, how charitable, how meek and lowly of heart would\nwe become, because we have learned of Him. How dimly we re-\nflect the great glory of our Lord! ... We need to behold him more\nsteadfastly, that we may be changed into his image.” 2\nIt is our hope and prayer that this book of devotional messages\nmay help every reader reach the goal set forth in the words of this\nold familiar hymn:\n“Be like Jesus, this my song,In the home and in the throng;\nBe like Jesus all day long!\nI would be like Jesus.”\nThe Trustees of\nThe Ellen G. White ® Estate\nSilver Spring, Maryland\n2ManuscriptReleases7:146.\nJanuary—Communing With God"
